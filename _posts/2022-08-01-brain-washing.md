## Who is programming your mind?

First we're programmed by formal institutions: schools, churches, our employers, police and the legal system. Then we spend most of our free-time getting programmed by advertisers, screen-writers, movie producers, actors, musicians and mobile apps.

The "average American" spends roughly [4 and a half hours on their phone](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1045353/mobile-device-daily-usage-time-in-the-us/#statisticContainer) every day (not including calls). Also in the US, adults are projected to have spent [13 hours per day consuming media](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/us-time-spent-with-media-2022).

But my point isn't to say you shouldn't watch TV or use social apps, it's just to recognize the impact it would have on our lives if we spent as much time working to program and empower our minds as we do consuming entertainment.

While commercial media teaches us to buy certain brands, or at least covet them, we should *program ourselves with powerful mental models that can give us an edge*.

Beyond all of the media and distractions of modern life, our biggest influences come through family, friends and our surrounding community. 

That's how people learn to be, by mirroring each-other, *consciously* adopting the habits of people we admire and other role-models, and at the same time *subconsciously* copying the habits of everyone we're surrounded with. We can leverage this fact as part of our self-education.

## Everyone wants to change

Everyone has habits they'd like to change, but mostly people stay on the same track until we HAVE TO change. 

Part of that reason is because of all of the forces influencing our actions. By the time we are in a position where we want to change a behavior, we're liable to have a variety of influences re-enforcing that undesired action.

The other reason it can be so hard to change our habits is that we are never trained or encouraged to do such self-programming. Where to begin? Cold turkey, New Years resolutions and support meetings all have their place, and work to an extent, but if they don't work: then what?

### We need a system of change

In order to make real change in our life, it will be helpful to have a map describing the terrain and a kit of tools and strategies to help us along the way.

When I finally quit drinking, I was both blessed and privileged to land in a supportive space where I could focus entirely on my recovery and wellbeing.

That's what I've done for the past 4 years, focus on creating new habits and changing the way I think. Now I've been along the journey long enough to have collected an arsenal of tools and techniques for personal growth and change and a reasonable map of the territory.

### Real change takes time. 

Everyone reading this wont necessarily have the same luxury of time and space with which to devote towards their brainwashing experience. Nor will everyone have as deep a recovery to work through on their personal growth journey.

My hope is for all of my readers to find something of value, and for myself to have a reference with which to readily recall practices and frameworks I've found helpful.

Deep change isn't about fixing an isolated problem, or chasing symptoms, but restructuring the entire system. We can strengthen our weak points, but first stimulating the growth and vitality of our strengths will take some of the pressure off of our weaknesses.

## Brainwashing: How To Guide

### A Map: Managing Relevant Psychological Conditions

For most of us on the journey to reprogram our minds, this "map" can concisely describe an integral core of that journey.

To that end, there are a handful of psychological conditions it wil be useful to familiarize ourselves with. 

We'll be working towards the ideal: *ego strength*, while contending with its challengers: *complexes*, *neuroses*, and *trauma*.

#### The Ideal: Ego Strength

[**Ego strength**](https://psychcentral.com/blog/relationships/2012/01/ego-versus-ego-strength-the-characteristics-of-healthy-ego?c=1426641193145#1) is the ideal psychological state we are working towards, that provides the perfect foundation for our personal development. 

At its core, ego strength relates to our basic life competence and capacity to deal with everyday challenges and social stresses. 

While ego strength is an ideal to work towards, its not necessarily the default state each of us will find ourselves in. 

When we first begin a significant self-improvement project, we often have some "big problem(s)" to solve. 

Those big problems are usually compounded by a number of contributing factors. Oftentimes if we get a handle on the small things, everything else is much more manageable, and our 'big problems' begin to fade.

You can build ego-strength by nurturing co-operative relationships, along with healthy habits and routines: from fitness to regular sleep and nutritious diet.

> Therapists often work on helping the client heal the primal wound that derailed [healthy ego development](](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/moral-landscapes/201908/self-transformation-step-1-building-the-ego)) (Balint, 1968). Therapists who demonstrate interest (not coldness), empathy (not distance), encouragement (not detachment) can set in motion positive change (Barish, 2019).

Gaining experience with a number of the techniques listed here over an extended period collectively builds the ego.

#### The Challengers: Complexes, Neuroses and Trauma

The term [**complex**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_(psychology)) was created by Carl Jung to describe a partially repressed but highly active and potent cluster of emotions, thoughts, and reactions. Complexes are not necessarily unhealthy, Jung even referred to the ego as a complex.

When we have powerful reactions that seem disproportionate to their relevance, this could be the result of a complex. 

A [**neurosis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jung%27s_theory_of_neurosis) is similar to a complex, but specifically refers to a situation where our conscious actions are in conflict with our unconscious attitude, because the unconscious material is too painful to manage consciously.

Probably everyone suffers from a variety of neuroses that may or may not disrupt our daily living. Most relevant to this discussion in circumstances when our unconscious attitude is in conflict with our conscious goals, leading to various forms of self-sabotage.

Everyone experiences [**trauma**](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/trauma) to varying degree, be it *shock trauma*,  stimulated by a particular event, or [*developmental trauma*](https://globalteletherapy.com/signs-of-developmental-trauma/) which builds up over a period of our childhood from a variety of influences, environmental and physical.

This trauma means that we don't always react rationally to situations that arise, but incidents that trigger unresolved traumas can lead to adverse reactions in seemingly unrelated areas.

Significant trauma can majorly impair our ability to maintain day to day affairs, family life, and\or careers. 

### Conscious Change
None of this work is a linear process as it may appear on the page. I've used whatever tools are appropriate in a given moment.

#### Therapy and Emotional Support
Any of these practices can be explored on your own, and\or in a group, and\or under the supervision of a trained therapist.

While seeking therapy used to be taboo, its now seen as a sign that someone is working to improve themselves, and has an emotional support system.

Especially if you are processing major traumas, you shouldn't try to go thru this journey on your own.

All the same, this process of personal reprogramming must be driven from within. Even the best therapist can only provide support and direction, we've got to do the work.

Beyond therapy, there are also numerous emotional support groups on facebook and [elsewhere](https://www.self.com/story/online-support-groups/) [online](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/group-therapy#summary).

#### Goals

You've got to have something that's not only worth living for, but worth thriving and being your best to better accomplish that goal. 

#### Life Review

Fully examined pain...

#### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy primarily revolves around challenging negative beliefs. This is probably the most popular form of therapy in the modern world. The reason its so popular is because of its speed and effectiveness. 

Regardless of how deep your challenges are, you can gain some benefits immediately beginning to challenge [Self Defeating Beliefs](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/f1e61-self-defeating-beliefs-list-v-1.pdf), and [Automatic Negative Thinking](https://sdlab.fas.harvard.edu/cognitive-reappraisal/identifying-negative-automatic-thought-patterns).

#### Shadow Work

 (what irritates you about others)... 

#### Self Education

Total Immersion... Can't erase old pathways have to create new ones... & Profit... Become like the people you surround yourself with (Podcasts)... Create content on subject you want to learn better... learn good enough to teach...

#### Emotional Intelligence


#### Sobriety

Because of the way alcohol dulls our experience of emotion, it will be challenging to make any real progress if regularly under the influence of alcohol. 

When I first quit drinking I had to go through months of detox, but its not just a physical detox. I had a lifetime of unprocessed emotions and experiences. 

Alcohol may not be your problem, but sobriety can mean different things to different people.

If you are using some substance or activity to avoid dealing with your emotions, then you have unprocessed issues influencing your decisions without your complete conscious awareness.

Not to say that to grow we must cast aside our vices entirely. However, each reduction in dependence upon substances or other distractions allows us to incrementally get in touch with and process repressed emotions (ouch!), and gain increased presence and peace of mind along with an increased capacity for growth on all other dimensions.
