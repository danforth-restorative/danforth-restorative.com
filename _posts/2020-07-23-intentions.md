I've been slowly unravelling, over the past few years, trying to figure out how I got to where I did, and how to rebuild my life on a firm foundation. If there was a single straightforward answer to those questions, then I might not need to make this blog.

<!-- excerpt -->

I don't seek to justify any of my actions, but I do recognize there are reasons beyond the surface. For example, I've always been pretty conflict avoidant. I bottled up frustrations, without confronting the person who stimulated them. That is part of a pattern of avoiding difficult emotions, that I see as close to the heart of my addictions.

Why didn't I confront my problems head on? Well, for one thing, I didn't have a positive means for doing so. A lot of what I was coming up against has its roots in retributive justice. I recognized an injustice, though didn't really understand it. All I knew is I didn't want to participate. 

I tried to get away, but had no conception of what I was running from, or even where I was trying to get to. In fact, I still possessed, at my core, the type of thinking at the root of what I was trying to evade. It's taken me too long to realize that what I was trying to escape from was embedded in my own consciousness.

I can't go back and change the past. What I can do, with the time I have, is try and improve the world and make it easier for others to avoid some of the pitfalls I've encountered. I believe there's some opportunity for me to leave the world better than I found it, and that's what I'm working towards now.
