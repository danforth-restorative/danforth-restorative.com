#### Focus

I read recently about a [new theory of attention](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/09/how-brain-helps-you-pay-attention/598846/) that I believe sheds some light on this subject, and maybe even help understanding the behavior surrounding addiction, more generally.

We think of our attention as a spotlight, when we direct our focus to a certain point, our light shines there. Instead neuroscientists find that the real work of focus is in filtering out everything else but the subject of your attention.

We've all heard this to be true, that our minds do more filtering out information than interpreting it, but I've never thought of it this way before.

This could help to explain why people consumed with addiction, or otherwise intensely fixated upon some objective, seem to easily lose sight of the needs of others.
