This is my personal blog, but it is also a place to share knowledge related to personal growth and social change. This post describes that relationship, and its connection to [digitalskills.info](https://digitalskills.info) where I share information for the development digital skills.

## A Personal Blog 

One purpose of this blog is to provide a space to reflect upon my addictions recovery, and share resources I've found most valuable for rebuilding my life. 

I will try to be vulnerable, and open up about some of my struggles.

One thing I've learned during this process is that focusing too much on my problems can get in the way of solving them. I've found it more productive to focus on developing strengths than to focus on weaknesses.

Its easy to get lost in self-judgement, the pain of remembrance, and dwelling on my failings. I've used that pain as a powerful incentive, devoting my energy to study, and the hard work of creating a life worth living. 

That is a continual practice, working towards positive for myself and others – an incremental process that, "one step at a time", has restored vibrancy to life – restructuring my thoughts, habits, hobbies and means of living.

### Danforth Restorative 

This blog is also a place to share resources that have been valuable in my healing process. Part of that has involved getting beyond my personal struggles, and joining the rally around social issues I remained willfully ignorant about for too long. 

I want to acknowledge the systemic problems of sexism and racism, and make the information surrounding them easier to navigate, for my own education and the benefit of others, on the web.

It's important to be aware of our personal and societal problems, but also to get practical, seeking creative ways to address those issues. 

## A Force Multiplier

I'm building [DigitalSkills.info](https://digitalskills.info) to further the development of my own skills and helping others develop theirs.

### DigitalSkills.Info

I've spent this time recovering from years of drug and alcohol abuse immersed in study, and developing marketable digital skills. Especially in the beginning, internet research became a replacement addiction. 

While there can be some challenging repercussions for obsessive studying, a lot healthier for my mind than drinking!

Drawing my focus on the multitude of challenges, technical and otherwise, of building a career online, I was able to find some relief from the initial agony of sobriety and facing my internal processes loud and clear, after years of dulling my senses in drink and drug.

That process has been very empowering, I got a taste for the impact one person can make on the web, simply making useful information more accessible. I've also gotten a taste for the powerful tools available, and how they can multiply the impact that one person can create.

### Transformative potential

The focus of DigitalSkills.Info is to help make digital skills more accessible. On one hand, they are increasingly required to be employable. On the other hand, these skills can prove invaluable for creating the social impact we want to see in the world.
