This is my personal blog, but it is also a place to share knowledge related to personal growth and social change. This post describes that relationship, and its connection to [digitalskills.info](https://digitalskills.info) where I share information for developing our digital skills.

## A Personal Blog 

One purpose of this blog is to provide a space to reflect upon my addictions recovery, and share resources I've found most valuable for rebuilding my life. This is a space where I will try to be vulnerable, and open up about some of my struggles. 

I know that my struggles do not exist in isolation, and I want to make this process transparent to any individuals or communities that I've impacted.

One thing I've learned during this process is that focusing too much on my problems can get in the way of solving them. It's too easy to get lost in self-judgement and the pain of remembrance. 

I've used that pain as a powerful incentive, devoting my energy to study, and the hard work of creating a life worth living. That is a continual practice, working towards positive for myself and others – a slow incremental progress that, little by little, has restored vibrancy to life – restructuring my thoughts, habits, hobbies and means of living.

This blog is also a place to get beyond my personal struggle, and raise up in the rallying cry around social issues I've stayed willfully ignorant about for too long. 

I want to acknowledge the systemic problems of sexism and racism, and make the information surrounding them easier to navigate. This is for my own education, to make them more approachable for others, on the web.

It's important to be aware of our personal and societal problems, but also to get practical, seeking creative ways to solve them. For me, that involves helping to proliferate the best information I can find, and create content that makes this more relatable to others.

### Digital Skills A Force Multiplier

In addition to my personal studies, I've spent these years in recovery immersed in the challenge of developing marketable digital skills. Especially in the beginning, this work has been a replacement addiction.

Drawing my focus on the multitude of challenges, technical and otherwise, of building a career online, I was able to find some relief from the initial agony of sobriety and facing my internal processes loud and clear, after years of dulling my senses in drink and drug.

That process has been very empowering, I got a taste for the impact one person can make on the web, simply making useful information more accessible. I've also gotten a taste for the powerful tools available on the web, and how they can multiply the impact that one person can make.

### Digital skills, personal growth, social struggles, and transformative potential

The focus of DigitalSkills.Info is to help make digital skills more accessible. On one hand, they are increasingly required to be employable. On the other hand, these skills can prove invaluable when used towards societal struggles.
