Since I've heard of the term "sexual objectification", I couldn't relate to it. If confronted with the idea of hyper-sexualization, or over-sexualization, I could have grappled. But objectification? 

The idea of thinking of women as objects doesn't make sense at face value. Though I've come to recognize objectification as the outcome of self-centeredness, or as describing the experience on the receiving end, rather than a stance that men take up consciously.  

That said, these aren't concepts I'd spent much time weighing. That was my privilege, that I didn't have to. What seems so crystal clear now, was a mystery to me, then. Looking back, I find a great deal of my behavior and ways of relating with women to be entirely absurd. 

Clearly this is no simple subject, and there will be no simple explanations. Instead, I've approached the problem from a number of angles, that I intend to explore further in this post, the first of a series.

## What even is Objectification?

It appears that the concept of objectification is at the heart of feminist literature and philosophy. If you are casually familiar with philosophy, those origins immediately explain the difficulty a lay-person might have in digesting it at face value.

In her 1995 paper, ["Objectification"](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1088-4963.1995.tb00032.x), Martha Nussbaum offers the following points to describe treating a person as an object: 
> 1. Instrumentality; The objectifier treats the object as a tool of his or her purposes. 
> 2. Denial of autonomy: The objectifier treats the object as lacking in autonomy and self-determination. 
> 3. Inertness: The objectifier treats the object as lacking in agency, and perhaps also in activity.
> 4. Fungibility: The objectifier treats the object as interchangeable (a) with other objects of the same type, and/or (b) with objects of other types. 
> 5. Violability: The objectifier treats the object as lacking in boundary-integrity, as something that it is permissible to break up, smash, break into. 
> 6. Ownership: The  objectifier treats the object as something that is owned by another, can be bought or sold, etc. 
> 7. Denial of subjectivity: The objectifier treats the object as something whose experience and feelings (if any) need not be taken into account.

In each of these 7, a description of how another is treated is given. Its not the matter of how a potential objectifier is thinking, or how they believe they relate with another. Objectification relates to the effects of our actions upon another.

[Rae Langton](http://web.mit.edu/langton/www/pubs/Projection&Objectification.pdf) (2009, 228–229) added a few more aspects of objectification to Nussbaum’s list:
> - reduction to body: the treatment of a person as identified with their body, or body parts;
> - reduction to appearance: the treatment of a person primarily in terms of how they look, or how they appear to the senses;
> - silencing: the treatment of a person as if they are silent, lacking the capacity to speak.

Upon reviewing these lists, I can recall how I've reflected those descriptions in my treatment of women.

**It was all about me. It was always all about me.** 

Rather than a conscious will to do harm, I was simply more consumed with myself and my own interests, than concerned for the women in my life. In the end it amounts to the same. 

If anything matters, it's the results of our actions, not the substance of our intentions.

## Digging to the roots

I wouldn't have come to these realizations without the help of community, finding rock bottom, and breaking free from the control of drugs and alcohol. But awareness is only a beginning. 

While I continue making considerable effort to transforming my own way of thinking and negative attitudes, personal reform isn't enough.

Along with my own study of materials available online, and at the local library, I can dissect my personal experience looking for common elements. Perhaps that experience can be redeemed still, and turned to the benefit of the commons.

### Contributing Factors

From the top of my head, what follows is a list of factors I believe that have contributed to my objectification of women.

* Lack of educating men on the experience of women
* Insufficient Development of *Social Skills*
* Insufficient *Emotional* and *Mental Hygiene*
* *Alcohol* and Drugs (*Addiction*)
* Inherited *societal norms*
* *Media* and *Advertising*
* Powers that benefit from subversion of women and conflict among the masses.

This list is roughly in order of importance & amount of influence I might have over them.

### Focus

I read recently about a [new theory of attention](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/09/how-brain-helps-you-pay-attention/598846/) that I believe sheds some light on this subject, and maybe even help understanding the behavior surrounding addiction, more generally.

We think of our attention as a spotlight, when we direct our focus to a certain point, our light shines there. Instead neuroscientists find that the real work of focus is in filtering out everything else but the subject of your attention.

We've all heard this to be true, that our minds do more filtering out information than interpreting it, but I've never thought of it this way before.

This could help to explain why people consumed with addiction, or otherwise intensely fixated upon some objective, seem to easily lose sight of the needs of others. 

## Moving forward

I have a lot to learn still. About the roots of objectification and misogyny, about masculinity, and maintaining a healthy relationships with myself and the greater community.

I can't turn back time, or excuse any of my past behavior. However, I do believe this is my true calling. To reach into the heart of these thorny matters and find a way forward; for myself and others seeking clarity and freedom surrounding these issues.

I haven't had the time to organize my thoughts here, in a while. But I am making efforts to arrange affairs so I can focus on factors contributing to mens objectification of women, full-time, and hope to be approaching that goal towards the new year.
