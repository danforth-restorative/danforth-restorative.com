Since I've heard of the term "sexual objectification", I found it challenging to relate with, and have noticed a similar phenomenon among other men.

Thinking of women as objects doesn't make sense at face value, and who wants to admit to themselves if they have? Much safer to think of other people as objectifying, if at all. 

Admittedly, I haven't spent much time thinking about the sexual objectification, until quite recently. 

As I've begun explore, it reminds me of other, more technical, subjects I've worked with. A proper understanding of sexual objectification is vital for the future of humanity, but the facts surrounding it are dense and difficult to assess.

Objectification is no simple problem, and there will be no simple solution. Here, I begin breaking it down into manageable lines of inquiry.

## What even is Objectification?

> Humanity is male, and man defines woman, not in herself, but in relation to himself - Simone de Beauvoir, [The Second Sex](https://libcom.org/files/1949_simone-de-beauvoir-the-second-sex.pdf)

> Simone de Beauvoir is talking about women for centuries for millennia, even up till the present in many cases, are placed in a situation where they're there primarily to function as an object to reflect back to men [...] that allows the men to feel assured of themselves – [Gregory B. Sadler; Woman as Other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSbg0YyuBqA) 

For Simone de Beauvoir, this treatment of woman is not unique to her condition. She proposes that any group defining themselves as superior always do so in juxtaposition with *the* [*Other*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy)). 

It will be worth considering "othering" and its role subjugating people, broadly speaking, in more detail. For now, lets move on to the specifics surrounding the objectification of women.

In her 1995 paper, ["Objectification"](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1088-4963.1995.tb00032.x), Martha Nussbaum offers the following points to describe the treatment of a person as an object: 
> 1. Instrumentality; The objectifier treats the object as a tool of his or her purposes. 
> 2. Denial of autonomy: The objectifier treats the object as lacking in autonomy and self-determination. 
> 3. Inertness: The objectifier treats the object as lacking in agency, and perhaps also in activity.
> 4. Fungibility: The objectifier treats the object as interchangeable (a) with other objects of the same type, and/or (b) with objects of other types. 
> 5. Violability: The objectifier treats the object as lacking in boundary-integrity, as something that it is permissible to break up, smash, break into. 
> 6. Ownership: The objectifier treats the object as something that is owned by another, can be bought or sold, etc. 
> 7. Denial of subjectivity: The objectifier treats the object as something whose experience and feelings (if any) need not be taken into account.

Men struggle relating to the idea of objectifying women, because we clearly (to ourselves) don't think of women as objects lacking agency or motive of their own. 

The problem isn't what men think about women, but how we treat women. 

With these descriptions, one can more readily define our behavior as objectifying or not.

[Rae Langton](http://web.mit.edu/langton/www/pubs/Projection&Objectification.pdf) (2009, 228–229) added a few more features to Nussbaum’s list:
> - reduction to body: the treatment of a person as identified with their body, or body parts;
> - reduction to appearance: the treatment of a person primarily in terms of how they look, or how they appear to the senses;
> - silencing: the treatment of a person as if they are silent, lacking the capacity to speak.

## Understanding objectification

The term objectification brings light to the experience of women, but, I believe, falls short from bringing men around to examine the impact of our actions.

Aided by the reflection of a sober mind, I can see myself in the above descriptions. 

It's painful for me to consider so plainly, which I'm sure makes it all the more difficult to address systemically. Those most in need of understanding are least incentivized to do so. 

How are we to understand objectification? 

How should we comprehend these behaviors and states of being that few would admit to possessing?

They are carried forward by entire societies, and are not merely isolated behaviors of the deranged. 

### What causes objectification?

Some men and women embrace their traditional roles both willingly and consciously, without necessarily expressing the most harmful examples of objectification. 

We all have inherited, or been impressed upon by, patriarchal and objectifying values, to one degree or another. 

I would go so far as to suggest that a worldview facilitating objectification is mans by default, overcome only by a concerted education and enculturation in our formative years, or by concerted effort and self-education as an adult.

There are a variety of factors that coalesce around this problem. 

I propose to carefully consider which factors promote the objectification of women and, for each, to determine approaches to reverse that impact, to be useful in different environments.


#### Education
* Lack of **education about the experience of women**
* Insufficient **Emotional and Mental Hygiene**
* Insufficient Development of **Social Skills**
* Lack of **Personal Growth** and Development

#### Culture
* **Alcohol** and Drugs (**Addiction**)
* **Sexual Taboo** and other **Societal norms**, present and cumulative.
* **Literature, Media** and **Advertising**
* **Powers who be**nefit from subversion of women, and conflict among people.

As with an individual's personal wellness, life challenges may arise from no single source, but through a combination of the environment in which one is brought into the world, our early experiences, family structure, and a certain "something" of our own that we each arrive with onto this plane.

It will also be necessary to look beyond the aggravating factors, to determine which practices promote mens relating with women as human beings, with no less respect than they might treat their fellow man. 

### Appreciating the world as experienced by women

Men will always have difficulty relating with women on their own terms, for as long as there is limited access to stories with women as lead characters, where their female supporting characters are portrayed with minimal depth, where objectifying values are present nearly universally across media that men are likely to consume.

I grew up in a world where the stories have been told primarily from the [male perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_gaze). For example, there is Philosophy, which means 'mens philosophy', and then there is Feminist Philosophy, which is women's philosophy. 

Another example would be movies, which have been primarily told from the male perspective, for a male audience, and then there are chick flicks. While these trends have begun to shift, the masculine lense is so prevalent we might be like the fish who don't recognize the water we're swimming in.

Growing awareness among men about how commonly stories are told from our perspective vs that of women will help.

More than that as men, spending time with a curated set of quality medias that exemplify womans voice intellect and prowess, for men more easily to view woman as a professional, as an intellectual, as an artist, and not first as a sexual being created for our pleasure.

### Mental and Emotional Hygiene

I hope it's not too much of a leap to suppose that men who objectify women could benefit from some practice in mental wellness, emotional intelligence. It's worth a gander to see if others have explored the link between these topics, beyond the colloquial. 

The fact is that emotional intelligence and mental health are both areas that have just come into their own in the past few decades, and there is much better care and information accessible than ever before.

### Social Skills Training

Another case related to mental & emotional health, and similarly, the knowledge in this field has blossomed only in recent decades, enabling much greater precision in communication with and understanding one-another. 

Today it's known scientifically how humans express body-language and otherwise best relate with one another. Unfortunately, that knowledge has largely been seen as a strategic advantage for those who know, and not yet been widely distributed.

### Sexual Taboo

Under the color of righteousness and morality, taboos around sex ensure that every 'good' parent is frightened to discuss sexual matters with children, or with children present. Religious parents refuse their children to participate in sexual education.

These taboos around sex ensure that young men primarily learn about sex from their peers, from other children who know barely more than they, instead of responsible and caring adults. By the time parents or educators get around to talking to children about sex, they've probably already received their most influential lessons on the subject.

These taboos around sex ensure that young men learn what there is to learn about sex from fellow school-children who have been influencing each-other across generations without the awareness or intervention of adults.

Especially when taboos are placed around natural human processes, drives, and behaviors that are commonplace, then we are much easier to manipulate.


#### Focus

I read recently about a [new theory of attention](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/09/how-brain-helps-you-pay-attention/598846/) that I believe sheds some light on this subject, and maybe even help understanding the behavior surrounding addiction, more generally.

We think of our attention as a spotlight, when we direct our focus to a certain point, our light shines there. Instead neuroscientists find that the real work of focus is in filtering out everything else but the subject of your attention.

We've all heard this to be true, that our minds do more filtering out information than interpreting it, but I've never thought of it this way before.

This could help to explain why people consumed with addiction, or otherwise intensely fixated upon some objective, seem to easily lose sight of the needs of others. 

## Moving forward

I have a lot to learn still. About the roots of objectification and misogyny, about masculinity, and maintaining a healthy relationships with myself and the greater community.

I can't turn back time, or excuse any of my past behavior. However, I do believe this is my true calling. To reach into the heart of these thorny matters and find a way forward; for myself and others seeking clarity and freedom surrounding these issues.

I haven't had the time to organize my thoughts here, in a while. But I am making efforts to arrange affairs so I can focus on factors contributing to mens objectification of women, full-time, and hope to be approaching that goal towards the new year.
