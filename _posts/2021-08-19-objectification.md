Since I've heard of the term "sexual objectification", I found it challenging to relate with, and have noticed a similar phenomenon among other men.

If confronted with the idea of hyper-sexualization, or over-sexualization, I could have related with. But objectification? 

Thinking of women as objects doesn't make sense at face value, and who wants to admit to themselves that they have? Much safer to think of other people as objectifying, if at all. 

The sexual objectification of women is a subject I haven't spent much time thinking about, until recently. Instead, I was busy participating with it.

Clearly this is no simple subject, and there will be no simple explanations. Instead I'll try to break it apart into manageable lines of inquiry.

## What even is Objectification?

The concept of objectification appears to be at the heart of feminist literature and philosophy. In her 1995 paper, ["Objectification"](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1088-4963.1995.tb00032.x), Martha Nussbaum offers the following points to describe treating a person as an object: 
> 1. Instrumentality; The objectifier treats the object as a tool of his or her purposes. 
> 2. Denial of autonomy: The objectifier treats the object as lacking in autonomy and self-determination. 
> 3. Inertness: The objectifier treats the object as lacking in agency, and perhaps also in activity.
> 4. Fungibility: The objectifier treats the object as interchangeable (a) with other objects of the same type, and/or (b) with objects of other types. 
> 5. Violability: The objectifier treats the object as lacking in boundary-integrity, as something that it is permissible to break up, smash, break into. 
> 6. Ownership: The  objectifier treats the object as something that is owned by another, can be bought or sold, etc. 
> 7. Denial of subjectivity: The objectifier treats the object as something whose experience and feelings (if any) need not be taken into account.

Men struggle relating to the idea of objectifying women, because we clearly (to ourselves) don't think of women as objects lacking agency or motive of their own. The mistake being a failure to take an additional step to wonder if a women has ever felt treated by us as an object.

[Rae Langton](http://web.mit.edu/langton/www/pubs/Projection&Objectification.pdf) (2009, 228–229) added a few more aspects of objectification to Nussbaum’s list:
> - reduction to body: the treatment of a person as identified with their body, or body parts;
> - reduction to appearance: the treatment of a person primarily in terms of how they look, or how they appear to the senses;
> - silencing: the treatment of a person as if they are silent, lacking the capacity to speak.

While a man might *think* of woman as divine, and believe he treats her fairly, she might experience him as the objectifier, while he carries on deluded. 

Then again, different women are most likely to experience the same set of behaviors radically differently from each-other.

The term objectification is useful for bringing light to the experience of women, but I believe it falls short from inspiring men to examine the impact of our actions.

Is objectification, perhaps, naturally camouflaged from detection by those engaged in it? 

## Understanding objectification

Aided by the reflection of a sober mind, I can certainly see myself in those descriptions of objectification. I wasn't immediately receptive to seeing a problem in myself, tho much more receptive than I imagine most men being.

Calling out objectifying behavior can be useful for men who are open and willing to change. Since objectifying behaviors can be rewarding for men, that stands as a barrier in the way of his understanding. Objectification is quite likely influenced by mental habits that appear harmless and enjoyable, on the surface. 

At the moment, causes and solutions to sexual objectification remain shrouded in mystery. This project is meant to bring clarity to both, and improve our ability to manage it in ourselves and our communities.

## What are the causes of objectification?

I've listed all the factors that occur to me as potentially bearing on objectification. 

Having developed over, at least, many thousands of years, across multiple cultures found across the globe, the objectification of women will have no specific and immediate cause which can be addressed and disposed of. 

I propose to carefully consider which factors promote the objectification of women, and for each we should determine a variety of approaches to these problems that can be used in different environments.

* Lack of **education on the experience of women**
* **Sexual Taboo**
* Insufficient **Emotional and Mental Hygiene**
* Insufficient Development of **Social Skills**
* Lack of **Personal Growth** and Development
* **Alcohol** and Drugs (**Addiction**)
* **Societal norms**, present and cumulative.
* **Literature, Media** and **Advertising**
* **Powers that be**nefit from subversion of women and conflict among people.

As with an individual's personal wellness, life challenges may arise from no single source, but through a combination of the environment in which one is brought into the world, our early experiences, family structure, and a certain "something" of our own that we each arrive with onto this plane.

It will be necessary to look beyond the aggravating factors, to determine which practices promote mens relating with women as human beings, with no less respect than they might treat their fellow man. 

### Appreciating the world as experienced by women

> Humanity is male, and man defines woman, not in herself, but in relation  to  himself; - [Simone De Beauvoir, The Second Sex](https://libcom.org/files/1949_simone-de-beauvoir-the-second-sex.pdf)

I grew up in a world where the stories have been told primarily from the [male perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_gaze). For example, there is Philosophy, which means 'mens philosophy', and then there is Feminist Philosophy, which is women's philosophy. 

I offer this example to illustrate the point which must be glaringly obvious to anyone living in a female body, but which I may never had occasion to notice if I hadn't gone out of my way to explore this subject.

Growing awareness among men about how commonly stories are told from our perspective vs that of women will help.

More than that as men, spending time with a curated set of quality medias that exemplify womans voice intellect and prowess, for men more easily to view woman as a professional, as an intellectual, as an artist, and not first as a sexual being created for our pleasure.

### Sexual Taboo

Taboos around sex ensure that every 'good' parent is frightened to discuss sexual matters with children, or with children present. Religious parents refuse their children to participate in sexual education (especially if it might be actually useful to its audience).

These taboos around sex ensure that young men learn what there is to learn about sex from fellow school-children, rather than potentially responsible and caring adults. 

Especially when taboos are placed around natural human processes, drives, and behaviors that are commonplace, then we are much easier to manipulate.

### Mental and Emotional Hygiene



#### Focus

I read recently about a [new theory of attention](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/09/how-brain-helps-you-pay-attention/598846/) that I believe sheds some light on this subject, and maybe even help understanding the behavior surrounding addiction, more generally.

We think of our attention as a spotlight, when we direct our focus to a certain point, our light shines there. Instead neuroscientists find that the real work of focus is in filtering out everything else but the subject of your attention.

We've all heard this to be true, that our minds do more filtering out information than interpreting it, but I've never thought of it this way before.

This could help to explain why people consumed with addiction, or otherwise intensely fixated upon some objective, seem to easily lose sight of the needs of others. 

## Moving forward

I have a lot to learn still. About the roots of objectification and misogyny, about masculinity, and maintaining a healthy relationships with myself and the greater community.

I can't turn back time, or excuse any of my past behavior. However, I do believe this is my true calling. To reach into the heart of these thorny matters and find a way forward; for myself and others seeking clarity and freedom surrounding these issues.

I haven't had the time to organize my thoughts here, in a while. But I am making efforts to arrange affairs so I can focus on factors contributing to mens objectification of women, full-time, and hope to be approaching that goal towards the new year.
