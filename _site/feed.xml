<p>I’m not entirely sure when I first heard the term, perhaps as recently as the early 2010’s, or shortly before. If I had heard the term in school, I don’t recall.</p>

<p>Thinking of women as objects doesn’t make sense at face value. I could see myself as over-sexualizing, though I didn’t have the words for that, either. I tried to consider if I participated in objectifying of women, and it simply didn’t compute to me.</p>

<p>Looking back now, it’s obvious that I have engaged in objectification. But even after it became clear that I have, I still wasn’t certain precisely what that meant.</p>

<h2 id="what-even-is-objectification">What even is Objectification?</h2>

<p>The word gets used a lot, popularly, we know the type of behavior it refers to, but do we know what it really means? The answer to that may depend on your experience on the receiving end of objectification.</p>

<p>I must properly assess and recognize objectifying tendencies within myself and the world around me, because I want to live in a world where people are treated as humans, not simply as vehicles for the fulfillment of someone elses fantasy.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-objectification">Understanding objectification</h3>

<p>Objectification is not a simple problem, but I've begun by breaking it down into manageable lines of inquiry.</p>

<p>While we are collectively used to thinking mainly of <i>sexual</i> objectification, objectification is also found in the practices of colonization, slavery, and is even found within common uses of our language.</p>

<p><blockquote>Humanity is male, and man defines woman, not in herself, but in relation to himself - Simone de Beauvoir, <a href="https://libcom.org/files/1949_simone-de-beauvoir-the-second-sex.pdf">The Second Sex</a></blockquote></p>

<p>From my own experience, and what I've heard among my peers, many men find it challenging to recognize objectification in our own behavior. But we don't necessarily go out of our way looking for it, either.</p>

<p>How often have women experienced my behavior as objectifying? That is clearly the question to ask.</p>

<p>The problem, of course, is that those most in need of asking that question have least incentive to do so.</p>

<h3 id="woman-as-other">Woman as Other</h3>

<p>Where I'm lacking the ability to experience objectification as far as its widely understood, I'll defer to some of the pioneering thinkers on the subject.</p>

<blockquote>
  Simone de Beauvoir is talking about women [...] up till the present in many cases, are placed in a situation where they're there primarily to function as an object to reflect back [...] that allows the men to feel assured of themselves – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSbg0YyuBqA">Gregory B. Sadler; Woman as Other</a>
</blockquote>

<p>In her 1995 paper, "<a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1088-4963.1995.tb00032.x">Objectification</a>", Martha Nussbaum offers the following points to describe the treatment of a person as an object:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Instrumentality; The objectifier treats the object as a tool of his or her purposes. </li>
  <li>Denial of autonomy: The objectifier treats the object as lacking in autonomy and self-determination. </li>
  <li>Inertness: The objectifier treats the object as lacking in agency, and perhaps also in activity.</li>
  <li>Fungibility: The objectifier treats the object as interchangeable (a) with other objects of the same type, and/or (b) with objects of other types. </li>
  <li>Violability: The objectifier treats the object as lacking in boundary-integrity, as something that it is permissible to break up, smash, break into. </li>
  <li>Ownership: The objectifier treats the object as something that is owned by another, can be bought or sold, etc. </li>
  <li>Denial of subjectivity: The objectifier treats the object as something whose experience and feelings (if any) need not be taken into account.</li>
</ol>

<p>Men struggle relating to the idea of objectifying women, because we don't necessarily have an experience <b>thinking</b> of women as objects. But here we are focused on the experience of women, not how men are thinking about their own behavior.</p>

<p><a href="http://web.mit.edu/langton/www/pubs/Projection&amp;Objectification.pdf">Rae Langton</a> (2009, 228–229) added a few more features to Nussbaum’s list:
<ul>
  <li>reduction to body: the treatment of a person as identified with their body, or body parts;</li>
  <li>reduction to appearance: the treatment of a person primarily in terms of how they look, or how they appear to the senses;</li>
  <li>silencing: the treatment of a person as if they are silent, lacking the capacity to speak.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>With these specific descriptions its much easier to identify where my own behaviors have fallen among this range.</p>

<h3 id="beyond-sexual-identification">Beyond Sexual Identification</h3>

<p>For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_de_Beauvoir">Simone de Beauvoir</a>, objectification is not unique to the experience of women. She proposes that any group defining themselves as superior always do so in juxtaposition with <b>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy">Other</a></b>. She posits the Objectification of women as an example of this <i>othering</i>, just as Black Americans, aboriginal peoples, and many peoples across the globe have been subjected to.</p>

<p>This post deals mainly with the objectification of women because of its relevance to my life experience, and as a starting point for further examination.</p>

<h2 id="causes-of-objectification">Causes of objectification?</h2>

<p>Our personalities and habits of mind are created through a combination of nature, biology, culture and upbringing.</p>

<p>Objectification, in the sense of othering, is an expression of power. We’ve all inherited, or been impressed upon by, patriarchal and objectifying values, in varying respects.</p>

<p>The patterns of objectification are systemic, being impressed upon us through our education and culture.</p>

<p>Its a mistake to think that objectification is primarily sexual in nature. A growing body of research supports that objectification is an expression of power.</p>

<h2 id="areas-for-improvement">Areas for Improvement</h2>

<p>Objectification has been handed down by dominators, as a component of the popular culture, in modern and ancient history. Even while structures that benefit from retaining status quo may encourage that culture, as a people we must create a focused effort to tend to redressing unhealthy patterns encouraged by those power structures.</p>

<p>Objectification has perpetuated because it benefits the powerful, and the masses have been largely compliant through ignorance, men seeing it as “just the way things are” unless given a specific education.</p>

<p>The following areas are contributing factors, and require improvements to reduce the spread of objectifying practices. Some of this has begun to change, but bears mention.</p>

<p><b><em>Education</em></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of <b>education about womens experience</b> being objectified.</li>
<li>Lack of emphasis in emotional intelligence through schools \ media.</li>
<li>Children are not taught proper social skills, but left to form a "natural" pecking order.</li>
<li>Lack in appropriate sexual education, and rites of passage appropriate to the modern world.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><em>Culture</em></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Alcohol</b> and Drugs (<b>Addiction</b>)</li>
<li><b>Sexual Taboo</b> and other <b>Societal norms</b>, present and cumulative.</li>
<li><b>Literature, Media</b> and <b>Advertising</b></li>
<li><b>Powers who be</b>nefit from subversion of women, and conflict among people.</li>
</ul>

<p>We prefer to simplify cause and effect to a linear relationship, but that's not how life works.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to look beyond the aggravating factors, to determine which practices promote healthy and respectful relations with all, regardless of dominant prejudice.</p>

<h3 id="education">Education</h3>
<h4 id="appreciating-the-world-as-experienced-by-others">Appreciating the world as experienced by others</h4>

<p>Film and Television has, up to this point, largely focused from the male perspective, its female characters supporting the male lead being portrayed with minimal depth. Men will always have difficulty relating with women on their own terms for as long as there is limited access to stories having women in lead roles.</p>

<p>Well, that is changing, especially with modern television programming and the popularization of youtube. To begin, the easiest thing any of us can do is spend time with a curated set of media exemplifying the 'others' in our world.</p>

<h4 id="mental-and-emotional-hygiene">Mental and Emotional Hygiene</h4>

<p>Emotional intelligence and mental health are both areas that have just come into their own over the past few decades, and there is much better care and information accessible than ever before.</p>

<p>I believe that our, to this point, limited knowledge of human psychology and practices supporting emotional wellness have played a lead role in enabling this type of objectifying behavior. To this point its largely remained in our collective shadow, evading conscious examination.</p>

<p>Left un-treated, it's common for anyone to have repressed and unprocessed suffering ([complexes](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_(psychology))) that can lead us to react irrationally and hurt the ones we love, not to mention people who we've set aside as 'other'.</p>

<h4 id="social-intelligence">Social Intelligence</h4>

<p>For most of us, we never got taught how to relate socially. The knowledge and research surrounding human social behaviors and body language has also blossomed in recent decades, enabling much greater precision in communication with and understanding amongst each-other.</p>

<p>That knowledge is becoming more widely available, but is far from systematically organized or widely accessible.</p>

<p>It will be so much easier for us to avoid objectification if we are better prepared to recognize and accept the human condition and experience.</p>

<h4 id="personal-growth-and-development">Personal growth and development</h4>

<p>While there are many avenues for developing ourselves as people, for many personal growth and development happens largely by accident, beyond whatever growth we enjoy through the care of standardized educational establishments. </p>

<p>While it's not as easy for adults to learn new skills or languages as it is for children, adults have every opportunity to continue our personal growth and development. However, we are left to our own devices in that regard, but are rather encouraged towards take whatever job we can get and busy ourselves around consumables.</p>

<p>Men who are lacking in the areas of personal growth and development are more likely to be insecure with themselves and more likely to fall to the relative comfort of assumed superiority and objectification.</p>

<h3 id="culture">Culture</h3>
<h4 id="addiction-alcohol">Addiction (alcohol)</h4>

<p>The problem of addiction follows along a path that our other factors have laid. It handily follows that if we have any weakness in emotional health, social skills, or are lacking in personal development, addiction awaits with arms open. </p>

<p>Any addiction could increase our tendency towards objectifying behavior, but alcohol's role deserves careful attention, since it's the most socially acceptable intoxicant that can significantly impact our judgement and character, by allowing us to avoid the natural pains of introspection.</p>

<h4 id="sexual-taboo">Sexual Taboo</h4>

<p>Under the color of righteousness and morality, taboos around sex ensure that every 'good' parent is frightened to discuss sexual matters with children, or with children present. Religious parents often refuse their children to participate in sexual education.</p>

<p>Taboos around sex ensure that children learn about sex from peers and pornography, instead of responsible and caring adults. By the time parents or educators get around to talking to children about sex, we've already gotten our worst and most influential lessons on the subject.</p>

<p>Especially when taboos are placed around natural human processes and drives, then we are much easier to manipulate. </p>

<p>I believe that until we learn to communicate with children in a natural way about sex, rather than leaving their first lessons in the hands of their crudest influences, we won't solve the problem of sexual objectification.</p>

<h4 id="media">Media</h4>

<p>Next to our education and recognition of womans experience in the world. The media (movies, television, music) are the vehicles used to propel culture across the globe.</p>

<p>I'll be interested to explore the history of objectification in literature and get a sense for its origins.</p>

<h3 id="moving-forward">Moving forward</h3>

<p>This outline marks the beginning of examining objectification and its causes. I intend to continue from here, to explore these themes in more detail.</p>

<p>I would like to understand objectification, more broadly, and determine how to combat its problematic elements.</p>

<p>To the extent that objectification is symptomatic, we must address the underlying causes, both individually and collectively.</p>

<p>What I haven’t included here is any discussion of any research findings that can help to inform of what objectification is and how it expresses physiologically, but also any insights from said research that might help to counteract its presence in our state of being.</p>

<h4 id="nvc-judging-what-people-are">Nonviolent Communication - Judging what people are</h4>

<p>Recently, I’ve had an interesting insight from my studies in Nonviolent Communication that sheds some light on the subject. In nonviolent communication, Marshall Rosenberg taught that the root of violence on the planet is use of static language judging what people are: (“You are incredible!” “You’re gross!”). Instead we communicate with people how we’re feeling as a result of their interaction with our needs. But that static language judging what people are is a type of objectification, too!!!</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Clearly there is a lot more to unpack, here. But this is a difficult subject to work on, in multiple ways. For now, still learning and growing.</p>]]></content><author><name>David Danforth</name></author><category term="Mens Health" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Humanity is male, and man defines woman, not in herself, but in relation to himself - Simone de Beauvoir]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://danforth-restorative.com/assets/images/objectification.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://danforth-restorative.com/assets/images/objectification.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The Rise of Nonviolence: Gandhi, King, Wink, Rosenberg</title><link href="https://danforth-restorative.com/2021/01/21/rise-of-nonviolence-gandhi-king-wink-rosenberg.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Rise of Nonviolence: Gandhi, King, Wink, Rosenberg" /><published>2021-01-21T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-01-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://danforth-restorative.com/2021/01/21/rise-of-nonviolence%E2%80%93gandhi-king-wink-rosenberg</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://danforth-restorative.com/2021/01/21/rise-of-nonviolence-gandhi-king-wink-rosenberg.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/assets/images/gandhi-king-wink-rosenberg.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>Mahatmas Gandhi was the first in modern times to take Jesus’ message of nonviolence seriously. Fueled by love, he galvanized a mass movement that helped to free India from British rule.</p>

<p>Inspired by the example of Gandhi’s nonviolent resistance, and also by the message of nonviolent Jesus, Martin Luther King Jr led the US civil rights movement that fought for equal treatment under the law for African Americans.</p>

<p>Gandhi and King offer powerful examples of what is possible with a commitment to nonviolent resistance, fueled by love. Their nonviolent practices have been followed to great effect, but their examples of love, in the face of oppression are harder to follow.</p>

<p>That could have something to do with that theologian Walter Wink called the Myth of Redemptive Violence, that’s been repeated in nearly every story ever told.</p>

<p>Similarly, Marshall Rosenberg found the root of violence in the way we speak and think. He also taught a language way of thinking to transform it into a way of thinking and speaking that serve life.</p>

<h2 id="nonviolent-impact">Nonviolent Impact</h2>

<p>This article follows the philosophy and practice of nonviolence, as taught and lived by some of its greatest leaders.</p>

<p>But first, lets step back and review what exactly is nonviolence, along with its impact and proliferation.</p>

<p>Nonviolence is not pacifism, nor does it mean simply abstaining from violence. Nonviolence is a creative pursuit which seeks peaceful means to resist oppression, resolve conflicts, and bring about change.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-future-of-nonviolent-resistance-2/"><img src="/assets/images/nonviolent-vs-violent.webp" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><strong>If you haven’t already been immersed in the culture and media of nonviolence, it may surprise you to learn that nonviolent resistance is more popular than ever, while also being more effective than violent strategies.</strong></p>

<p>As long as we are reliant on corporate media for news about the world, we’re unlikely to learn about the rise of nonviolence or its growing impact on our planet.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-future-of-nonviolent-resistance-2/"><img src="/assets/images/nonviolent-vs-violent-success-rates.webp" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>One reason for that is that humans have evolved so that <a href="https://letter.ly/negative-news-statistics/">negative stories and experiences captivate us more deeply</a> than positive stories and experiences.</p>

<p>Another reason is that the corporate media has a lot more funding and is highly organized in a centralized fashion, where nonviolence is a grass-roots affair that is only beginning to achieve a measure of global co-ordination.</p>

<h3 id="opposition-vs-proliferation-of-nonviolence">Opposition vs Proliferation of Nonviolence</h3>

<p>In <a href="https://1lib.us/book/1309893/256eca">Nonviolence: the history of a dangerous idea</a>, Mark Kurlansky tells the story of proponents of nonviolence, throughout the ages, and the opposition they have faced from the state.</p>

<p>Throughout the ages, champions of nonviolence have been persecuted and crucified, their message co-opted and modified, its intent suppressed, to enable violence enforced by the state.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolence:_The_History_of_a_Dangerous_Idea">25 Lessons of Nonviolence</a> (from Kurlansky’s book):</p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Practitioners of nonviolence are seen as enemies of the state.</li>
    <li>Once a state takes over a religion, the religion loses its nonviolent teachings.</li>
    <li>A rebel can be defanged and co-opted by making him a saint after he is dead.</li>
    <li>Somewhere behind every war there are always a few founding lies.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>For all of the opposition that these ideas and their adherents have faced, the heart of nonviolence persists more widely-known and practiced than ever before.</p>

<p>Today, activists have an arsenal of nonviolent techniques, tried and tested, at our disposal.</p>

<p>The Albert Einstein Institution has classified <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/peace-conflict/pdfs/198-methods-non-violent-action.pdf">198 METHODS OF NONVIOLENT ACTION</a> into three broad categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>protest and persuasion</strong></li>
  <li><strong>noncooperation</strong> (social, economic, and political)</li>
  <li><strong>nonviolent intervention</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>A description and historical examples of each can be found in <a href="https://www.aeinstein.org/books/the-politics-of-nonviolent-action-part-2/">Volume Two of The Politics of Nonviolent Action, by Gene Sharp</a> (<a href="https://www.aeinstein.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Preview-Politics-Part-II.pdf">preview</a>).</p>

<h2 id="nonviolent-roots">Nonviolent Roots</h2>

<p>Here I’d like to set the backdrop by exploring the two most widely successful and well-known leaders of nonviolent resistance. Its important to consider what made these men great, what is their philosophy, and what is the structure of their practice?</p>

<h3 id="mahatma-gandhi-1869--1948">Mahatma Gandhi (1869 – 1948)</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/mahatma-gandhi-310552_Clker-Free-Vector-Images.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>Teachers of nonviolent practices and philosophy stretch back through recorded history. However, Gandhi was the first leader to take that message to the global stage. He brought together the principles of nonviolence into a coherent teaching and practice that have been used effectively to combat injustices and win political causes.</p>

<p>The spiritual component was central to the message of Gandhi. He preached a message of love, self sacrifice, and willingness to suffer for a cause. He was a devout soul who had a way of attracting national attention to his causes, bringing pressure to authorities, affecting positive change.</p>

<p>There are <strong>three central components to Gandhian nonviolence</strong>. <em>Ahimsa</em>, <em>satyagraha</em>, and <em>tapasya</em>.</p>

<h4 id="ahimsa">Ahimsa</h4>

<p>Literally speaking, <strong>Ahimsa</strong> is a Sanskrit term meaning ‘non-injury’ or ‘non-killing’. Gandhi developed the term more fully to mean non-violence in thought, word, or deed towards all sentient beings. The term also implies strength of will, which Gandhi believed to be the seat of our power, rather than physical force.</p>

<p>Ahimsa, like nonviolence, is a general term under which a variety of practices could be categorized.  Truth and Love are at the core of Ahimsa, which is not related to pacifism, or a simple failure to harm, but an active process of doing good.</p>

<h4 id="satyagraha">Satyagraha</h4>

<p><strong>Satyagraha</strong>, on the other hand, involves practical use of nonviolent techniques for resisting unjust laws. It fulfills of ahimsa in the political realm.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyagraha"><em>Satyagraha</em></a> is a compound word made of the words <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya"><em>satya</em></a> and <em>agraha</em>. Satya means truth or essence, it root <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sat_(Sanskrit)"><em>sat</em></a> stands for <em>being</em> or <em>the true essence</em>. <a href="https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/agraha#sanskrit">Agraha</a> means willpower, determination or persistance.</p>

<p>In short, satyagraha involves living aligned with ones true essence with great determination.</p>

<p>Passive resistance does not necessarily avoid violence on principle, or love, but of necessity. Satyagraha is a force of love. Its greatest intent is not to defeat an opponent, but to win them over and convert them with heart, patience and steadfastness of purpose.</p>

<p>Satyagraha, in fullness, does not involve winning at all costs, but is devoted first, to the truest or highest principle of being (<em>sat</em>).</p>

<h4 id="tapasya">Tapasya</h4>

<p>The greatest weapon of Gandhian nonviolence is <strong>Tapasya</strong>, or voluntary suffering. Gandhi was a man of great determination and willingness to suffer for what is right. He believed that suffering for a cause to be more effective at converting others to his cause than discussion alone.</p>

<p>Adherents of satyagraha suffer wrong with love in their heart, with the intention of winning over the wrongdoer. The satyagrahi does not equate the person with the harm that they bring about.</p>

<p>When a devoted practitioner finds a situation of harm they are willing to suffer for and can arouse a significant number of those subjected to the cause, much good can be done to bring about change in the matter.</p>

<p>These people take a pledge and begin a program of self-purification. This helps to strengthen their resolve, and ensure this path is undertaken from a moral high-ground.</p>

<h4 id="techniques">Techniques</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fasting</strong> - Fasting is a means for self-purification in preparation for a nonviolent campaign. Fasting is a spiritual tool and can also make a potent statement for your cause. A number of times Gandhi undertook a “fast unto death”, for serious grievances, successfully effecting reversal of injustices.</li>
  <li><strong>Peaceful Picketing</strong> - Rallying people to promote their message in public to generate a consciousness of the issue at hand.</li>
  <li><strong>Civil Disobedience</strong> - Peacefully disobeying unjust laws. Requires a general respect for the law, while disobeying a specific unjust law.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-cooperation</strong> - While the government may perpetrate injustice, it also requires the participation of the people. Non-cooperation involves the people systematically withdrawing from participation with all aspects of unjust systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Constructive Program</strong> - It’s important not only to protest and call for reform of practices we want abolished, but to establish a program for the overall betterment of our communities and society at large. The better and more positive structures we construct, the less need for civil resistance.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="martin-luther-king-jr-1929---1968">Martin Luther King Jr (1929 - 1968)</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/martin-luther-king-OpenClipart-Vectors.webp" alt="" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The whole Gandhian concept of satyagraha (<em>satya</em> is truth which equals love, and <em>graha</em> is force; <em>satyagraha</em> thus means truth-force or love-force) was profoundly significant to me. As I delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see for the first time that the Christian doctrine of love operating through the Gandhian method of nonviolence was one of the most potent weapons available to oppressed people in their struggle for freedom. - <a href="https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/pilgrimage-nonviolence">Martin Luther King Jr.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. King’s earliest encounter with nonviolent resistance was reading Henry David Thoreau’s Civil Disobedience, while at Morehouse. During his studies in theological seminary he became influenced by the social gospel, reading <a href="http://www.americanyawp.com/reader/20-the-progressive-era/walter-rauschenbusch-christianity-and-the-social-crisis-1907/">Christianity and the Social Crisis</a> by Walter Rauschenbusch. He then began a serious study of the social and ethical theories of the great philosophers. King had become quite skeptical of the power of love in resolving social struggles, that was until he encountered the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi.</p>

<p>Little did he know that he would soon play an active role in nonviolent resistance. After graduating seminary, King became a pastor in Montgomery Alabama, where he was appointed spokesperson for the protesters who organized the Montgomery bus boycotts. During this time, his mind was drawn back to Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount and Gandhi’s methods of nonviolent resistance, seeing how Jesus provided the spirit and Gandhi provided the methods.</p>

<p>A few years later, <a href="https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/india-trip">he would travel to India</a>, to deepen his understanding of Gandhian Nonviolence and see its impact first-hand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Since being in India, I am more convinced than ever before that the method of nonviolent resistance is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for justice and human dignity. In a real sense, Mahatma Gandhi embodied in his life certain universal principles that are inherent in the moral structure of the universe, and these principles are as inescapable as the law of gravitation”</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="three-major-evils">Three Major Evils</h4>

<p>Dr King spoke of 3 types of violence that he worked against, calling them the <strong>Three Major Evils</strong>. Those evils are <em>racism</em>, <em>poverty</em>, and <em>militarism</em>. He saw them as inter-related, if we are to combat one of them, then we must combat them all.</p>

<p>In order to work against these evils, it’s required to develop a nonviolent state of being. King outlined 6 principles to serve as a foundation for his teaching of nonviolent conflict resolution.</p>

<h4 id="6-principles-of-nonviolence"><a href="https://rcnv.org/resources/principles-nonviolence-martin-luther-king-jr/">6 Principles of Nonviolence</a></h4>

<ul>
  <li>PRINCIPLE 1: Nonviolence is a way of life for courageous people.</li>
  <li>PRINCIPLE 2: Nonviolence seeks to win friendship and understanding, for the creation of the <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/19/01/achieving-kings-beloved-community">beloved community</a>.</li>
  <li>PRINCIPLE 3: Attack forces of evil not persons doing evil.</li>
  <li>PRINCIPLE 4: Accept suffering without retaliation for the sake of the cause to achieve a goal.</li>
  <li>PRINCIPLE 5: Avoid internal violence of the spirit as well as external physical violence.</li>
  <li>PRINCIPLE 6: The universe is on the side of justice</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="6-steps-of-nonviolent-social-change">6 Steps of Nonviolent Social Change</h4>

<p>These principles have much in common with Gandhian values. They are meant to arouse our will to good and guide our efforts.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Information gathering</strong>: To understand and articulate an issue, problem or injustice facing a person, community, or institution, you must do research. You must investigate and gather all vital information from all sides of the argument or issue to increase your understanding of the problem. You must become an expert on your opponent’s position.</li>
  <li><strong>Education</strong>: It is essential to inform others, including your opposition, about your issue. This minimises misunderstandings and gains your support and sympathy.</li>
  <li><strong>Personal commitment</strong>: Daily check and affirm your faith in the philosophy and methods of nonviolence. Eliminate hidden motives and prepare yourself to accept suffering, if necessary, in your work for justice.</li>
  <li><strong>Discussion/negotiation</strong>: Using grace, humour and intelligence, confront the other party with a list of injustices and a plan for addressing and resolving these injustices. Look for what is positive in every action and statement the opposition makes. Do not seek to humiliate the opponent but to call forth the good in the opponent.</li>
  <li><strong>Direct action</strong>: These are actions taken when the opponent is unwilling to enter into, or remain in, discussion/negotiation. These actions impose a “creative tension” into the conflict, supplying moral pressure on your opponent to work with you in resolving the injustice.</li>
  <li><strong>Reconciliation</strong>: Nonviolence seeks friendship and understanding with the opponent. Nonviolence does not seek to defeat the opponent. Nonviolence is directed against evil systems, forces, oppressive policies, unjust acts, but not against persons. Through reasoned compromise, both sides resolve the injustice with a plan of action. Each act of reconciliation is one step close to the ‘Beloved Community.’</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="beloved-community">Beloved Community</h3>

<p>The Beloved Community is a term coined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Royce">Josiah Royce</a>, founder of the <a href="https://forusa.org/">Fellowship of Reconciliation</a>, of which King was a member. Dr. Kings vision of Beloved Community is a world of economic and social justice, where conflicts are resolved peacefully.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dr. King’s Beloved Community is a global vision, in which all people can share in the wealth of the earth. In the Beloved Community, poverty, hunger and homelessness will not be tolerated because international standards of human decency will not allow it. Racism and all forms of discrimination, bigotry and prejudice will be replaced by an all-inclusive spirit of sisterhood and brotherhood. In the Beloved Community, international disputes will be resolved by peaceful conflict-resolution and reconciliation of adversaries, instead of military power. Love and trust will triumph over fear and hatred. Peace with justice will prevail over war and military conflict. - <a href="https://thekingcenter.org/about-tkc/the-king-philosophy/">King Philosophy</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="roots-of-violence">Roots of Violence</h2>

<p>Gandhi and King have both achieved great works with nonviolent methods. They led movements that challenged the injustices in their worlds, and affected great change. They each held firm to a message of love, at the core of their frameworks for nonviolence.</p>

<p>While their teaching and practices can be followed to great effect, if we wish to follow in their footsteps, it may serve us to first deal with the the source of violence in our lives, and understand how the ideology of violence proliferates.</p>

<p>For that, we’ll explore two other important (but lesser-known than King or Gandhi) figures in nonviolence.</p>

<h3 id="walter-wink-1935---2012">Walter Wink (1935 - 2012)</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/walter-wink.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>Walter wink was an American biblical scholar, theologian, activist and advocate of nonviolent resistance. He had a way of uncovering potent truths in well-worn scriptures, and wrote <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/121850.Jesus_and_Nonviolence">Jesus and Nonviolence: A Third Way</a> describing <a href="https://cpt.org/files/BN%20-%20Jesus%27%20Third%20Way.pdf">Jesus’s message of nonviolence</a>, as being far from passive resistance, but instead, as a radical and creative force.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jesus does not encourage Jews to walk a second mile in order to build up merit in heaven, or to be pious, or to kill the soldier with kindness. He is helping an oppressed people find a way to protest and neutralize an onerous practice despised throughout the empire. He is not giving a nonpolitical message of spiritual world transcendence. He is formulating a worldly spirituality in which the people at the bottom of society or under the thumb of imperial power learn to recover their humanity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wink’s explanation of Jesus’ nonviolence distinctly reminds me of the methods employed by Gandhi and King. I would highly recommend a reading of Wink along with the above mentioned <a href="https://1lib.us/book/1309893/256eca">Nonviolence: the history of a dangerous idea</a>, by Mark Kurlansky.</p>

<p>Wink also is known for discovering the “Myth of Redemptive Violence”. He explains that this <em>myth of redemptive violence</em> has a stronger grasp on the world than any other.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The story that the rulers of domination societies told each other and their subordinates is what we today might call the Myth of Redemptive Violence. It enshrines the belief that violence saves, that war brings peace, that might makes right. It is one of the oldest continuously repeated stories in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the <a href="http://www2.goshen.edu/~joannab/women/wink99.pdf">Myth of Redemptive Violence</a>, Walter Wink relates how he noticed this same pattern repeating in the structure of cartoons. There is a hero who suffers under the bad guy, and the hero has to vanquish the bad guy and restore order. They never reconcile or figure out creative ways to solve their problems, but forever repeat this same pattern.</p>

<p>This pattern stretches back throughout recorded history, all the way back to <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/article/225/enuma-elish---the-babylonian-epic-of-creation---fu/">Enuma Elish</a>, a Babylonian creation epic. Now that I’ve seen it, I see it everywhere. <em>Hidden in plain sight</em> for thousands of years. I can’t help but think that Walter Wink is tremendously under-appreciated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A domination system must have a domination myth, how­ ever, a story to explain how things got this way. For a story told often enough, and confirmed often enough in daily life, ceases to be a tale and is accepted as reality itself. And when that happens, people accept the story even if it is destroying their lives. – <a href="https://1lib.us/book/2495538/aa9274">The Powers That Be: Theology for a New Millennium</a>, Walter Wink</p>

<h3 id="marshall-b-rosenberg-1934---2015">Marshall B. Rosenberg (1934 - 2015)</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/marshall-rosenberg.webp" alt="" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we change ourselves we can change the world, and changing ourselves begins with changing our language and methods of communication. -Arun Gandhi</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marshall Rosenberg is an American psychologist who designed the process called <a href="https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/book-chapter-1">Nonviolent communication</a>, and taught its practice and underlying philosophy.</p>

<p>Growing up, Marshall Rosenberg experienced both tremendous violence, and great compassion. He studied psychology hoping to learn what made it so that some people come to enjoy violence and others give compassionately with joy.</p>

<p>He saw that religions all agree that love and compassion are the way to live, but didn’t provide a process on how to go about how to live that way.</p>

<p>With his studies in psychology, learning from the people he knew who most enjoyed compassionate giving, and researching the best thought available on these subject, Marshall created a process, philosophy and practice called Nonviolent Communication (NVC).</p>

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>

<p>Marshall often said that for over 10,000 years people have been living under domination structures where some claim to be superiors having the right to control others because they know what is best. The structures have educated us to use a language that disconnects us from our power, and look to authority on how to live.</p>

<p>Intwined with this language is a system of retributive justice that declares if you are judged as bad by the authorities then you deserve to suffer and be punished. If you are judged as good by authorities, then you deserve to be rewarded.</p>

<p>Dr. Rosenberg believed that this system of thinking in a static way judging what people are, combined with the system of retributive justice, are at the heart of violence on our planet.</p>

<p>Marshall Rosenberg often quoted Walter Wink, and his teaching of Nonviolent Communication elaborates how the Myth of Redemptive violence is born out in our thoughts and speech.</p>

<h4 id="premise">Premise</h4>

<p>Nonviolent communication is a language, philosophy and communication system designed with the intent that the needs of all participants are met.</p>

<p>That we give solely out of the joy that comes naturally from contributing to life, our own life and the lives of others.</p>

<p>Marshall tells us that others can’t make us feel anything, but its the way that we think that determines how we feel.</p>

<p>The process of nonviolent communication provides us with the language, thinking, and practices that support us in connecting with ourselves and others in a way that promotes compassionate giving.</p>

<p>NVC is practiced with the intention that whenever we give, its done solely out of the joy that comes naturally from contributing to life; our own life and the lives of others.</p>

<p>The intention is that whatever we do is done willingly, not done out of guilt, shame, or fear of punishment, or trying to buy love, by submitting to what we think others expect us to do.</p>

<p>Likewise, that whatever we ask of others, we wish their cooperation only if it can be done with that same compassionate giving, never out of guilt, shame, or fear of punishment.</p>

<p>Inbal and Miki Kashtan highlight the following <a href="https://baynvc.org/key-assumptions-and-intentions-of-nvc/">Key Assumptions and Intentions of NVC</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All human beings share the same needs</li>
  <li>All actions are attempts to meet needs</li>
  <li>Feelings point to needs being met or unmet</li>
  <li>The most direct path to peace is through self-connection</li>
  <li>Choice is internal</li>
  <li>All human beings have the capacity for compassion</li>
  <li>Human beings enjoy giving</li>
  <li>Human beings meet needs through interdependent relationships</li>
  <li>Our world offers abundant resources for meeting needs</li>
  <li>Human beings change</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll add a few ideas I think are close to the heart of NVC:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Never hear what people think about you, hear the need they are expressing.</li>
  <li>We often don’t recognize what need we’re trying to meet by an action.</li>
  <li>Conflicts often resolve when both parties recognize each-others needs.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="process">Process</h4>

<p><strong>Avoid</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Avoid any language that sounds like criticism, blame, or insults.</li>
  <li>Avoid presenting requests in a way where others hear demands.</li>
  <li>Anytime people hear criticism or demands, that makes it very difficult for people to enjoy contributing to one another’s well being.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="4-components-of-nonviolent-communication"><a href="https://www.cnvc.org/online-learning/nvc-instruction-guide/nvc-instruction-guide">4 Components of Nonviolent Communication</a></h5>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Observation</strong>:  Observation without evaluation consists of noticing concrete things and actions around us. We learn to distinguish between judgment and what we sense in the present moment, and to simply observe what is there.</li>
  <li><strong>Feeling</strong>:  When we notice things around us, we inevitably experience varying emotions and physical sensations in each particular moment. Here, distinguishing feelings from thoughts is an essential step to the NVC process.</li>
  <li><strong>Needs</strong>:  All individuals have needs and values that sustain and enrich their lives. When those needs are met, we experience comfortable feelings, like happiness or peacefulness, and when they are not, we experience uncomfortable feelings, like frustration.  Understanding that we, as well as those around us, have these needs is perhaps the most important step in learning to practice NVC and to live empathically.</li>
  <li><strong>Request</strong>:  To make clear and present requests is crucial to NVC’s transformative mission. When we learn to request concrete actions that can be carried out in the present moment, we begin to find ways to cooperatively and creatively ensure that everyone’s needs are met.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="distinguish-between">Distinguish between</h5>

<p><strong>Feelings vs. Thoughts</strong> - We often use the words “I feel” followed by a description of what we think about a matter. Feelings are happy, sad, hurt, longing, angst, etc, rather than “I feel that is wrong”.</p>

<p><strong>Needs vs. Strategies</strong> - Needs are universal and fundamental to life. We all have the same needs, such as food, shelter, acceptance and belonging. Strategies are how we seek to meet our needs. Our conflicts are always at the level of strategy, our conflicts are never at the level of our needs.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/power-love.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr are incredible examples of what is possible when nonviolent resistance is undertaken with a heart of love and compassion.</p>

<p>The difficulty is that the atmosphere of our times is not always conducive to nurturing that heart and spirit.</p>

<p>Walter Wink helps us to understand how we’ve learned to believe that violence saves, and paints a radical portrait of Jesus as using creative solutions to social injustice. Marshall Rosenberg expanded upon Wink’s message uncovering the root of violence in our language. He also furnished a system that helps to undo the ways of thinking that contribute to violence.</p>

<p>I’ve found that exploring the teachings of Walter Wink and Marshall Rosenberg have greatly improved my relationships and overall temperament, providing a means of working towards the purity of heart evidenced in the lives of heros like Martin Luther King Jr and Mahatma Gandhi.</p>

This post describes that relationship, and its connection to <a href="https://digitalskills.info">digitalskills.info</a> where I share information for the development digital skills.</p>

<h2 id="a-personal-blog">A Personal Blog</h2>

<p>One purpose of this blog is to provide a space to reflect upon my addictions recovery, and share resources I’ve found most valuable for rebuilding my life.</p>

<p>I will try to be vulnerable, and open up about some of my struggles.</p>

<p>One thing I’ve learned during this process is that focusing too much on my problems can get in the way of solving them. I’ve found it more productive to focus on developing strengths than to focus on weaknesses.</p>

<p>Its easy to get lost in self-judgement, the pain of remembrance, and dwelling on my failings. I’ve used that pain as a powerful incentive, devoting my energy to study, and the hard work of creating a life worth living.</p>

<p>That is a continual practice, working towards positive for myself and others – an incremental process that, “one step at a time”, has restored vibrancy to life – restructuring my thoughts, habits, hobbies and means of living.</p>

<h3 id="danforth-restorative">Danforth Restorative</h3>

<p>This blog is also a place to share resources that have been valuable in my healing process. Part of that has involved getting beyond my personal struggles, and joining the rally around social issues I remained willfully ignorant about for too long.</p>

<p>I want to acknowledge the systemic problems of sexism and racism, and make the information surrounding them easier to navigate, for my own education and the benefit of others, on the web.</p>

<p>It’s important to be aware of our personal and societal problems, but also to get practical, seeking creative ways to address those issues.</p>

<h3 id="digitalskillsinfo">DigitalSkills.Info</h3>

<p>I’ve spent this time recovering from years of drug and alcohol abuse immersed in study, and developing marketable digital skills. Especially in the beginning, internet research became a replacement addiction.</p>

<p>While there can be some challenging repercussions for obsessive studying, a lot healthier for my mind than drinking!</p>

<p>Drawing my focus on the multitude of challenges, technical and otherwise, of building a career online, I was able to find some relief from the initial agony of sobriety and facing my internal processes loud and clear, after years of dulling my senses in drink and drug.</p>

<p>That process has been very empowering, I got a taste for the impact one person can make on the web, simply making useful information more accessible. I’ve also gotten a taste for the powerful tools available, and how they can multiply the impact that one person can create.</p>

<p>I first encountered this message in a youtube video from an April 2000 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TONauJGfc">introductory workshop hosted by Marshall Rosenberg</a>. In this video, Marshall shares stories of using this technique for negotiation in longstanding tribal conflicts, racial violence, marital disputes and healing emotional wounds.</p>

<p>Nonviolent communication provides clarity around how we think about our emotions and fundamental human needs, laying the groundwork for empathic connection with the people in our lives.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Rosenberg">Marshall Rosenberg</a> developed this system after having grown up experiencing, both, extreme violence and compassion under difficult conditions. He went on to study psychology with the intention to discover what conditions contribute to violence on the planet and what helps us connect us with our compassionate nature.</p>

<p>Earning a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Dr. Rosenberg found that <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190708131152.htm">psychiatric diagnoses have no scientific basis</a>, and that looking at violence as a mental illness ignored the societal structures that promote this behavior.</p>

<p>He found that religions of the world agree we’re meant to live compassionately, but don’t necessarily explain how to do that. He then studied the differences between the people, he knew, who were the most compassionate, and those who seemed to enjoy criticizing, blaming, and attacking others. He used this research along with his education in psychology to develop this process called Nonviolent Communication (NVC).</p>

<p>While developing NVC, Marshall found the process to be much more effective as a healing tool, in his practice of clinical psychology, than how he was taught to do psychotherapy in university.</p>

<h2 id="premise">Premise</h2>

<p>Nonviolent communication requires a radical transformation of our habits in communication.</p>

<p>Dr. Rosenberg suggests that people have been <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/transformation/transforming-powers-continuing-relevance-of-walter-wink/">living under domination structures</a> for most of recorded history, where some people claim to be superior, having the right to control others.</p>

<p>People living under those structures have been taught a system of retributive justice, where if you are judged as good by authorities then you deserve to be rewarded, and <a href="http://www2.goshen.edu/~joannab/women/wink99.pdf">if you are judged as bad by the authorities, you deserve to suffer</a>. Additionally, we’ve learned to use a type of <em>language that describes what people are</em>: <strong>good</strong>, <strong>bad</strong>, <strong>right</strong>, <strong>wrong</strong>; rather than how their actions impact our lives.</p>

<p>Dr. Rosenberg taught that whenever we’re feeling anger, depression, guilt, or shame, we’re thinking in a way that contributes to violence, a way of thinking designed to make us obedient to authority.</p>

<p>In his studies Marshall found, from the research of OJ Harvey, who took samples of literature from around the world, a high <a href="https://archive.org/stream/conceptualsystem00harv/conceptualsystem00harv_djvu.txt">correlation between the language of moralistic judgement and violence</a>.</p>

<p>In contrast, Nonviolent communication focuses our attention on whether actions are fulfilling our needs or not. Our own actions, and the actions of others.</p>

<p>Instead of judging what people are, we make clear observations of whether their actions are fulfilling our needs. If our needs are not met, then we follow up our observation with a clear request of what would meet those needs.</p>

<p>If our needs are met by their actions, we clearly communicate an appreciation of how our lives have been enriched.</p>

<h2 id="components">Components</h2>

<p>The language of nonviolent communication consists of <strong>Feelings</strong>, <strong>Needs</strong>, <strong>Observations</strong> and <strong>Requests</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="feelings">Feelings</h3>

<p>The process of nonviolent communication begins with our feelings, and requires that we learn to identify and name our emotions. To help with that there are some lists of different type of feeling words.  To say ‘I feel good’, or ‘I feel bad’, isn’t very descriptive.</p>

<p>If we do feel good, there are likely a number of other words that would more adequately convey what’s alive in us. Just as when we aren’t feeling well, there are more descriptive words that can more accurately convey our emotional state.</p>

<p>An important premise underlying nonviolent communication is that it’s our thinking that causes our emotions, not external events. Other people’s words or behavior may very well be the stimulus for our feelings, but they are never the cause.</p>

<h3 id="needs">Needs</h3>

<p>In nonviolent communication, part of understanding our feelings is identifying which needs of ours are related to those feelings.</p>

<p>Dr. Rosenberg developed a list of what he determined to be <a href="https://www.nycnvc.org/feelings/">funadmental human needs</a>, based on <a href="http://www.daghammarskjold.se/wp-content/uploads/1989/05/89_1.pdf">the work of Max-Neef</a>, a Chilean economist who determined that the best way to measure an economy based on whether it’s meeting the needs of its people or not.</p>

<h4 id="needs-vs-strategies">Needs vs Strategies</h4>

<p>A premise of NVC is that all actions are attempts to meet human needs, and that our conflicts are never at the level of those needs, but in the strategies we employ attempting to meet those needs.</p>

<p>Looking for the un-met need helps us to transcend the strategy level, where we can easily get caught in conflict.</p>

<h3 id="observations">Observations</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The ability to observe without evaluating is the highest form of intelligence.” - Jiddu Krishnamurti</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Begin with a clear observation of what behavior has stimulating our emotions, avoiding language that sounds like criticism or blame.</p>

<p>This part might sound simple, but we’re accustomed to making evaluations of what type of person they are, because of their actions, rather than how those actions affected our needs.</p>

<p>Observations are contrasted with diagnoses. An observation connected with a need might sound like, “I have a need for tranquility when its time for bed, and when you didn’t come home on time angry and afraid”. The diagnosis could sound like “you don’t care about me, you only ever think of yourself”.</p>

<p>Both of those statements could be a response to the same situation, but in nonviolent communication we avoid diagnosing what we think people are. We create clear observations of a behavior and which needs of ours were, or were not, met by that behavior.</p>

<h3 id="requests">Requests</h3>

<p>If our needs are not met in a situation, it’s important to be clear what would meet our needs in this moment, avoiding vague language, or only stating what you don’t want.</p>

<p>We might like for others to anticipate our needs before we even are aware of them, but often we’re not very clear ourselves about exactly what will meet our needs.</p>

<h4 id="requests-vs-demands">Requests vs Demands</h4>

<p>Avoid presenting requests in a way that sound like a demand.</p>

<p>Whenever we get people to do things from fear of punishment, shame or guilt, we are experienced as a source of violence, who will make the suffer if they don’t comply.</p>

<p>To illustrate the danger of a language that denies choice, Rosenberg provides the example of Nazi war criminal Adolph Eichmann.</p>

<p>At his war trial, asked if it was difficult to send thousands to their deaths, Eichmann responded that their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk9-3bMAGBw">bureaucratic language</a> made it easy. If someone asked why they did it, they would say ‘I had no choice’, ‘superiors orders’, ‘it’s the law’.</p>

<p>Because of this concern, nonviolent communication emphasizes that we avoid any language that implies we have no choice, and suggests that the use of words like ‘have to’, ‘ought’, ‘must’ results in people who don’t feel responsible for their actions.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Nonviolent communication has a handful of moving parts, and involves learning a new way to think about ourselves and our relationships. While it’s not an overly complex system, it does express some profound truths that I’m not sure I’m able to properly convey.</p>

<p>One of the most impactful, to me, is the concept of retributive justice. I’ve begun to see how deeply ingrained it is, in my own consciousness, and the world around me.</p>

<p>I feel like there’s a lot of ground for me to cover still, in nonviolent communication. I intend to spend a lot more time working on this, what I believe to be the most valuable teaching available for promoting peace on the plant.</p>

<p>Before I quit drinking, I’d been on a downward spiral for quite some time. My behavior and mindset deteriorated to a shameful state. I was stuck in a cycle of addiction that I didn’t know how to escape.</p>

<p>When I drank, I didn’t have to be concerned with anything of import, I’d regulate my emotions with a 6 pack. I knew I had to find a different way, but that was easier said than done.</p>

<p>Gratefully, I had some help coming to the stark realization of exactly how far I’d fallen, and a family who cares to support the long road of recovery.</p>

<!-- excerpt -->

<p><img src="/assets/images/david.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I grew up with a lot of pain that I attributed to the world around me. While I had some just grievances, much of my angst was misguided. It’s taken far too too long, for me to realize that.</p>

<p>Instead I bitterly rejected what I saw as adversarial social convention meant to control. I inherently distrusted all social structures, which was a direct impediment to becoming a part of anything larger than myself.</p>

<p>I had the idea that the world was broken. That corruption and lies were embedded into every sphere of life, that the system was set up against the many for the benefit of the few. While that may be true, my reaction to those perceived injustices increased my own suffering and that of others.</p>

<p>While I shed the external trappings of domination, I fell straight into the awaiting trap, seeking fulfillment in drugs, alcohol, sex, self-serving pursuits and fleeting experiences. I was full of bitterness, on a self-indulgent trip simply trying to escape, doing nothing to improve my situation or the world around me.</p>

<p>In the intervening years, plenty of others have worked tirelessly, to make the world a better place, and improved many of the issues I care about.. while I had relinquished my agency, refusing to recognize my capacity to make an impact.</p>

<p>I have a lot of remorse, and have suffered a great deal of anguish about some of my actions and state of being over the years I spent growing consumed in addiction. I was judgemental, self-righteous, had an unhealthy attitude towards women, made increasingly poor decisions, and grew to cherish vice over reason.</p>

<h3 id="nonviolent-communication">Nonviolent Communication</h3>

<p>A major turning point in my recovery has been finding <a href="https://baynvc.org/basics-of-nonviolent-communication/"><strong>Nonviolent Communication</strong></a> (NVC). I started listening to workshops given by Marshall Rosenberg, at the recommendation of a counselor. NVC is now the cornerstone to my adult development journey, easily the most valuable teaching I’ve ever encountered, for those seeking peacefully abundant co-existence with our neighbors.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nonviolent communication (NVC) consists of a value system that challenges ways of thinking that create violence on this planet. 
<a href="https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/book-chapter-1">Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life</a> - Marshall Rosenberg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The purpose of nonviolent communication is to communicate in such a way where the needs of all participants are met, so that co-operation is come to willingly, never out of guilt, shame, or from trying to buy approval.</p>

<p>Even being new to the subject, learning about the process and it’s underlying philosophy, my relationship with family rapidly improved, and I was able to move past a great deal of anger, by recognizing where it’s misplaced.</p>

<p>The message of Nonviolent Communication has helped to begin repairing old wounds, and show me a path towards life enriching human relationships.</p>

<h3 id="trying-to-find-a-path-forward">Trying to find a path forward</h3>

<p>Throughout my life, I’ve wasted a lot of time and privilege in pursuit of mere enjoyment of my experience. It’s important for me now to not only find healing, but make whatever positive impact in the lives of others that I’m able.</p>

<p>Over the past year, I’ve delved into racism in the United States, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), emotional literacy, mindfulness, restorative practices, the mechanics behind addiction.</p>

<p>I want to learn and relate compassionately and constructively with the struggles we all face, with recognition towards struggles I’ll never have to face or fully understand.</p>

<p>There are systems that perpetuate harm that I unconsciously fell into compliance or cooperation with, I now break from such compliance wherever I am aware, and actively pursue such awareness.</p>]]></content><author><name>David Danforth</name></author><category term="Danforth Restorative" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I quit drinking and drugs almost three years ago, although I've only been approaching something resembling sobriety since the beginning of this year.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://danforth-restorative.com/assets/images/Danforth-Restorative-og_MAKY_OREL.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://danforth-restorative.com/assets/images/Danforth-Restorative-og_MAKY_OREL.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
