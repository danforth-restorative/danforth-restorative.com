    <p>Since I’ve heard of the term “sexual objectification”, I found it challenging to relate with, and have noticed a similar phenomenon among other men.</p>

<p>I’m not entirely sure when I first heard the term, perhaps as recently as the early 2010’s, or shortly before. If I had heard the term in school, I don’t recall.</p>

<p>Thinking of women as objects doesn’t make sense at face value. I could see myself as over-sexualizing, though I didn’t have the words for that, either. I tried to consider if I participated in objectifying of women, and it simply didn’t compute to me.</p>

<p>Looking back now, it’s obvious that I have engaged in objectification. But even after it became clear that I have, I still wasn’t certain precisely what that meant.</p>

<h2 id="#what-even-is-objectification">What even is Objectification?</h2>

<p>The word gets used a lot, popularly, we know the type of behavior it refers to, but do we know what it really means? The answer to that may depend on how often you've experienced objectifying treatment.</p>

<p>Based on my experiences, and recognizing the collective sexual disfunction humanity suffers by, I've come to recognize that a proper assessment of objectification is necessary. </p>

<p>I must properly recognize objectifying tendencies within myself, then identify its implications across various domains and applications. </p>

<h3 id="#no-simple-problem">No simple problem</h3>

<p>Objectification is no simple problem, and there will be no simple solution. Here, I've begun breaking it down into manageable lines of inquiry.</p>

<p>Some argue that objectification is not always a bad thing, but might be an integral component of a healthy romantic relationship. Perhaps, once I've fully explored negative aspects of objectification, I might consider its potential benefits.</p>

<h3 id="#understanding-objectification">Understanding objectification</h3>

<p><blockquote>Humanity is male, and man defines woman, not in herself, but in relation to himself - Simone de Beauvoir, <a href="https://libcom.org/files/1949_simone-de-beauvoir-the-second-sex.pdf">The Second Sex</a></blockquote></p>

<p>While men find it challenging to relate objectification to our own behavior, I wonder how often we deeply consider whether others might experience our actions as objectifying? That is clearly the question to ask. </p>

<p>It's painful to consider so plainly, ways I've objectified others, making it all the more difficult to address systemically. Those most in need of understanding have least incentive to do so. </p>

<h3 id="#woman-as-other">Woman as Other</h3>

<p>Where I'm lacking the ability to experience objectification as far as its widely understood, I'll defer to some of the pioneering thinkers on the subject.</p>

<blockquote>
  Simone de Beauvoir is talking about women [...] up till the present in many cases, are placed in a situation where they're there primarily to function as an object to reflect back [...] that allows the men to feel assured of themselves – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSbg0YyuBqA">Gregory B. Sadler; Woman as Other</a>
</blockquote>

<p>In her 1995 paper, "<a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1088-4963.1995.tb00032.x">Objectification</a>", Martha Nussbaum offers the following points to describe the treatment of a person as an object:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Instrumentality; The objectifier treats the object as a tool of his or her purposes. </li>
  <li>Denial of autonomy: The objectifier treats the object as lacking in autonomy and self-determination. </li>
  <li>Inertness: The objectifier treats the object as lacking in agency, and perhaps also in activity.</li>
  <li>Fungibility: The objectifier treats the object as interchangeable (a) with other objects of the same type, and/or (b) with objects of other types. </li>
  <li>Violability: The objectifier treats the object as lacking in boundary-integrity, as something that it is permissible to break up, smash, break into. </li>
  <li>Ownership: The objectifier treats the object as something that is owned by another, can be bought or sold, etc. </li>
  <li>Denial of subjectivity: The objectifier treats the object as something whose experience and feelings (if any) need not be taken into account.</li>
</ol>

<p>Men struggle relating to the idea of objectifying women, because we don't necessarily have an experience *thinking* of women as objects. But here we are focused on the experience of women, not defensive protestations</p>

<p><a href="http://web.mit.edu/langton/www/pubs/Projection&amp;Objectification.pdf">Rae Langton</a> (2009, 228–229) added a few more features to Nussbaum’s list:
<ul>
  <li>reduction to body: the treatment of a person as identified with their body, or body parts;</li>
  <li>reduction to appearance: the treatment of a person primarily in terms of how they look, or how they appear to the senses;</li>
  <li>silencing: the treatment of a person as if they are silent, lacking the capacity to speak.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>If you are still struggling, consider that objectification describes how under-privileged people are often treated, and how they experience that treatment, not so much how the objectifier perceives their own actions.</p>

<h3 id="#beyond-sexual-identification">Beyond Sexual Identification</h3>

<p>For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_de_Beauvoir">Simone de Beauvoir</a>, objectification is not unique to the experience of women. She proposes that any group defining themselves as superior always do so in juxtaposition with <b>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy">Other</a></b>. She posits the Objectification of women as an example of this *othering*, just as Black Americans, aboriginal peoples, and many others across the globe have been subjected to.</p>

<p>This post deals mainly with the objectification of women because it’s most relevant to my experience, and its most widely relatable in that context.</p>

<p>The more I think upon this topic, the easier it becomes for me to see objectification in other spheres of life. Upon examination, I would imagine we’ve all been objectified, and objectified others, to one extent or anther.</p>

<p>In future studies, I intend to explore objectification more broadly, to describe its effects seen in other areas of our lives, and in particular as it relates to colonization.</p>

<h2 id="#causes-of-objectification">Causes of objectification?</h2>

<p>Some men and women embrace their traditional roles both willingly and consciously, without necessarily expressing the most harmful examples of objectification.</p>

<p>We all have inherited, or been impressed upon by, patriarchal and objectifying values, to one degree or another.</p>

<p>I’ve organized what appear to me as influences leading towards the objectification of women into two categories <strong>Education</strong> and <strong>Culture</strong>.</p>

<p><b><em>Education</em></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of <b>education about the experience of women</b></li>
<li>Insufficient <b>Emotional and Mental Hygiene</b></li>
<li>Insufficient Development of <b>Social Skills</b></li>
<li>Lack of <b>Personal Growth</b> and Development</li>
</ul>

<p><b><em>Culture</em></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Alcohol</b> and Drugs (<b>Addiction</b>)</li>
<li><b>Sexual Taboo</b> and other <b>Societal norms</b>, present and cumulative.</li>
<li><b>Literature, Media</b> and <b>Advertising</b></li>
<li><b>Powers who be</b>nefit from subversion of women, and conflict among people.</li>
</ul>

<p>Life challenges arise from no single source, but from a combination of our environment: early experiences, family structure, and a certain "something" of our own that we arrive with when entering this plane.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to look beyond the aggravating factors, to determine which practices promote healthy and respectful relations with all, regardless of dominant prejudice.</p>

<h2 id="#education">Education</h2>
<h3 id="#appreciating-the-world-as-experienced-by-others">Appreciating the world as experienced by others</h3>

<p>Film and Television has, up to this point, largely focused from the male perspective, its female characters supporting the male lead being portrayed with minimal depth. Men will always have difficulty relating with women on their own terms for as long as there is limited access to stories having women in lead roles.</p>

<p>Well, that is changing, especially with modern television programming and the popularization of youtube. To begin, the easiest thing any of us can do is spend time with a curated set of media exemplifying the 'others' in our world.</p>

<h3 id="#mental-and-emotional-hygiene">Mental and Emotional Hygiene</h3>

<p>Emotional intelligence and mental health are both areas that have just come into their own over the past few decades, and there is much better care and information accessible than ever before.</p>

<p>I believe that our, to this point, limited knowledge of human psychology and practices supporting emotional wellness have played a lead role in enabling this type of objectifying behavior. To this point its largely remained in our collective shadow, evading conscious examination.</p>

<p>Left un-treated, it's common for anyone to have repressed and unprocessed suffering ([complexes](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_(psychology))) that can lead us to react irrationally and hurt the ones we love, not to mention people who we've set aside as 'other'.</p>

<h3 id="#social-intelligence">Social Intelligence</h3>

<p>For most of us, we never got taught how to relate socially. The knowledge and research surrounding human social behaviors and body language has also blossomed in recent decades, enabling much greater precision in communication with and understanding amongst each-other.</p>

<p>That knowledge is becoming more widely available, but is far from systematically organized or widely accessible.</p>

<p>It will be so much easier for us to avoid objectification if we are better prepared to recognize and accept the human condition and experience.</p>

<h3 id="#personal-growth-and-development">Personal growth and development</h3>

<p>While there are many avenues for developing ourselves as people, for many personal growth and development happens largely by accident, beyond whatever growth we enjoy through the care of standardized educational establishments. </p>

<p>While it's not as easy for adults to learn new skills or languages as it is for children, adults have every opportunity to continue our personal growth and development. However, we are left to our own devices in that regard, but are rather encouraged towards take whatever job we can get and busy ourselves around consumables.</p>

<p>Men who are lacking in the areas of personal growth and development are more likely to be insecure with themselves and more likely to fall to the relative comfort of assumed superiority and objectification.</p>

<h2 id="#culture">Culture</h2>
<h3 id="#addiction-alcohol">Addiction (alcohol)</h3>

<p>The problem of addiction follows along a path that our other factors have laid. It handily follows that if we have any weakness in emotional health, social skills, or are lacking in personal development, addiction awaits with arms open. </p>

<p>Alcohol use is practically culturally mandated in the United States. Not to say there aren't plenty of non-drinkers, but if you want to make friends it will be a lot harder without alcohol.</p>

<p>All of that would be fine, except the fact that alcohol impairs our judgement, is addictive, and we are especially vulnerable to it in combination with factors listed above. </p>

<p>Any addiction could increase our tendency towards objectifying behavior, but alcohol's role deserves careful attention, since it's the most socially acceptable intoxicant that significantly impacts on our thoughts and behavior.</p>

<h3 id="#sexual-taboo">Sexual Taboo</h3>

<p>Under the color of righteousness and morality, taboos around sex ensure that every 'good' parent is frightened to discuss sexual matters with children, or with children present. Religious parents refuse their children to participate in sexual education.</p>

<p>These taboos around sex ensure that children mostly learn about sex from their peers, who know barely more than they, instead of responsible and caring adults. By the time parents or educators get around to talking to children about sex, we've already gotten our most influential lessons on the subject.</p>

<p>Especially when taboos are placed around natural human processes and drives, then we are much easier to manipulate. </p>

<p>In the scheme of things, I believe that until we learn to communicate with children in a natural way about sex, rather than leaving their first lessons in the hands of their crudest peers, then we won't solve the problem of sexual objectification.</p>

<h3 id="#media">Media</h3>

<p>This section is probably the most obvious and straightforward, next to our education and recognition of womens experience in the world. The media (movies, television, music) are the vehicles we use to propel our culture across the globe. These are typically created to attract consumers along whatever lines we are likely to be attracted, without care for the broader societal impact.</p>

<p>I'll be interested to explore the history of objectification in literature, if for no other reason than its a lot easier to pick a starting point with far less media to sort through, but also to try and get a sense for the origins of objectification.</p>

<h2 id="#moving-forward">Moving forward</h2>

<p>This outline marks the beginning of examining objectification and its causes. I intend to continue from here, to explore these themes in more detail.</p>

<p>I would like to understand objectification, more broadly, and determine how to combat its problematic elements.</p>

<p>The plan is to much more than simply learn, write, and think about these topics, but discover creative means for addressing them systemically.</p>

<p>What I think we'll find is that the largest components of this work won't necessarily appear to deal with objectification. To the extent that objectification is symptomatic, we must address the underlying issues, one after another, and together in concert.</p>
