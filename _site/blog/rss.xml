      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Sharing on Personal Development and Social Change</em></strong></p>
<h2>Danforth Restorative the Blog</h2>
<p>This blog is a place for me to reflect upon my addictions recovery, and share resources I've found most valuable for rebuilding my life. </p>
<p>It's important for me to not only restore my own wellbeing, but to share of how I'm learning to do so, and work to improve the lives of others.</p>
<p>I want to use this space to open up and be vulnerable about some of the challenges I've struggled with. </p>
<p>I know that my struggles do not exist in isolation, and I want to make this process transparent to any individuals or communities that I've impacted, paving a way forward for myself, and perhaps others, with the common human challenges that we face.</p>
<p>While soulful introspection is invaluable, it's too easy to get lost in the pain of remembrance. </p>
<p>Once the initial drive to repentance is sparked, and an open acknowledgement of ways my behavior has brought pain to the lives of others, overly dwelling in this type of sorrow and agony wasn't making me a better person. </p>
<p>I've had to use that pain as a powerful incentive to learn, work hard and do the multitude of things that gradually, little by little, would restore vibrancy to life, by restructuring my thoughts, habits, and hobbies.</p>

<p>This blog is also a place to get beyond my personal struggle, and get practical, with information and other resources for becoming the person I want to become, and raise up in the rallying cry around issues I've stayed willfully ignorant about for too long.</p>
<p>I've spent my years in recovery immersed in the challenge, also, of acquiring marketable digital skills. </p>
<p>Becoming entirely absorbed with technical and other challenges of building a career online from scratch, I was able to find some relief from the initial agony of sobriety and facing my internal processes loud and clear, after years of dulling my senses in drink and drug.</p>
<p>I've also been deeply searching and keeping track of my findings on a number of topics that are essential for my own development and recovery, as well as the divided world we are struggling within.</p>
<p>This space is my home for the intersection where digital skills, personal growth, social struggles, and transformative potential all come together.</p>
<p>I do intend to create a 501c3, and would like for this to become an actual organization of people who are learning together about all of the above and simple ways that digital tools can expand the reach and potency of our most important messages.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Intentions for this Blog</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been slowly unravelling, over the past few years, trying to figure out how I got to where I did. If there was a single straightforward answer to that question, then I might not need to make this blog.</p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<p>I don't seek to justify any of my actions, but I do recognize there are reasons beyond the surface. For example, I've always been pretty conflict avoidant. I bottled up frustrations, without confronting the person who stimulated them. That is part of a pattern of avoiding difficult emotions, that I see as close to the heart of my addictions.</p>
<p>Why didn't I confront my problems head on? Well, for one thing, I didn't have a positive means for doing so. A lot of what I was coming up against has its roots in retributive justice. I recognized an injustice, though didn't really understand it. All I knew is I didn't want to participate. </p>
<p>I tried to get away, but had no conception of what I was running from, or even where I was trying to get to. In fact, I still possessed, at my core, the type of thinking at the root of what I was trying to evade. It's taken me too long to realize, what I was trying to escape from was embedded in my own consciousness.</p>
<p>I can't go back and change the past. What I can do, with the time I have left, is try and make it easier for others to avoid some of the pitfalls I've encountered. Maybe there's still an opportunity for me to leave the earth better than I found it.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Introduction to Nonviolent Communication</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Nonviolent communication is a value system designed to promote peace on the planet. </p>
<p>It includes a philosophy and communication framework that lead to compassionate giving and meeting the needs of all participants.  </p>
<p>I first encountered this message in a youtube video from an April 2000 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TONauJGfc">introductory workshop hosted by Marshall Rosenberg</a>. Marshall shares stories of using this technique for negotiation in longstanding tribal conflicts, racial violence, marital disputes, and healing mental\emotional wounds. </p>
<p>It's underlying philosophy provides clarity around how we think about our emotions and fundamental human needs, and lays the groundwork for empathic connection with the people in our lives.</p>

<p>There's no way I can capture the full impact of his message in this post. If you're interested, check out that video, and at the end of this post I'll provide some more resources for further study.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Rosenberg">Marshall Rosenberg</a> developed this system after having grown up experiencing both extreme violence and compassion under difficult conditions. He went on to study psychology with the intention to discover what conditions contribute to violence on the planet, and what helps us connect us with our compassionate nature. </p>
<p>Earning a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Dr. Rosenberg found that psychiatric diagnoses had <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190708131152.htm">no scientific basis</a>, and that looking at violence as a mental illness ignored the societal structures that promote this behavior.</p>
<p>He found that religions of the world agree we're meant to live compassionately, but don't necessarily explain how to do that. Approaching the problem in another manner he studied the differences between the people he knew who were the most compassionate, and those who seemed to enjoy criticizing, blame, and attacking others. He used this research along with his education in psychology to develop this process of nonviolent communication.</p>
<p>While developing NVC, he found the process to be much more effective as a healing tool in his practice of clinical psychology than how he was taught to do psychotherapy in university.</p>
<h2>Premise</h2>
<p>Nonviolent communication requires a radical transformation of our habits in communication. </p>
<p>Dr. Rosenberg suggests that people have been <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/transformation/transforming-powers-continuing-relevance-of-walter-wink/">living under domination structures</a> for most of recorded history, where some people claim to be superior, having the right to control others. People living under those structures have been taught a system of retributive justice, where if you are judged as good by authorities then you deserve to be rewarded, and <a href="http://www2.goshen.edu/~joannab/women/wink99.pdf">if you are judged as bad by the authorities, you deserve to suffer</a>. Additionally, we've learned to use a type of <em>language that describes what people are</em>: <strong>good</strong>, <strong>bad</strong>, <strong>right</strong>, <strong>wrong</strong>; rather than how their actions affect our lives.</p>
<p>Dr. Rosenberg says that whenever we're feeling anger, depression, guilt, or shame, we're thinking in a way that contributes to violence, a way of thinking designed to make us obedient to authority.</p>
<p>OJ Harvey took samples of literature from around the world to discover how often language was used judging people's actions in this way, and then correlated that with measures of violence towards oneself and others, finding a high <a href="https://archive.org/stream/conceptualsystem00harv/conceptualsystem00harv_djvu.txt">correlation between the language of moralistic judgement and violence</a>. </p>
<p>In contrast, Nonviolent communication focuses our attention on whether actions peoples actions are fulfilling our needs or not. Our own actions, and the actions of others. </p>
<p>Instead of judging what people are, we make clear observations of how actions are impacting needs. If our needs are not met, then we follow up our observation with a clear request of what would meet those needs.</p>
<h2>Components</h2>
<p>The language of nonviolent communication consists of <strong>Feelings</strong>, <strong>Needs</strong>, <strong>Observations</strong> and <strong>Requests</strong>.</p>
<h3>Observations</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The ability to observe without evaluating is the highest form of intelligence.&quot; - Jiddu Krishnamurti</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Begin with a clear observation of what behavior is stimulating us to say something, avoiding language that sounds like criticism or blame. </p>
<p>This part might sound simple, but it's more common to tell people our evaluation of them in relation to the behavior, rather than its relationship with our needs. </p>
<h3>Feelings</h3>
<p>The process of nonviolent communication begins with our feelings, and requires that we learn to identify and name our emotions. To help with that there are some lists of different type of feeling words.  To say 'I feel good', or 'I feel bad', isn't very descriptive. Even if we do feel good, there are likely a number of other words that would more adequately convey what's alive in us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“People are disturbed not by things, but by the view they take of them.” —Epictetus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An important premise underlying nonviolent communication is that it's our thinking that causes our emotions, not external events. Other people's words or behavior may very well be the stimulus for our feelings, but they are never the cause.</p>
<p>In nonviolent communication, part of identifying our feelings discovering which need of ours is related to that emotion.</p>
<h3>Needs</h3>
<p>Dr. Rosenberg developed a list of what he determines to be <a href="https://www.nycnvc.org/feelings/">funadmental human needs</a>, based on <a href="http://www.daghammarskjold.se/wp-content/uploads/1989/05/89_1.pdf">the work of Max-Neef</a>, a Chilean economist who determined that the best way to measure an economy based on whether it's meeting fundamental human needs or not.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>CONNECTION</strong>: acceptance, affection, appreciation, belonging, cooperation, communication, closeness, community, companionship, compassion, consideration, consistency, empathy, inclusion, intimacy, love, mutuality, nurturing, respect/self-respect, safety, security, stability, support, to know and be known, to see and be seen, to understand and be understood, trust, warmth</li>

<li><strong>PLAY</strong>: joy, humor</li>

</ul>
<h4>Needs vs Strategies</h4>
<p>A premise of NVC is that all actions are attempts to meet human needs, and that our conflicts are never at the level of those needs, but in the strategies we employ attempting to meet those needs.</p>
<p>Looking for the un-met need helps us to transcend the strategy level, where we can easily get caught in conflict.</p>
<h3>Requests</h3>
<p>If our needs are not met in a situation, it's important to be clear what would meet our needs in this moment, avoiding vague language, or only stating what you don't want. </p>
<p>We might like for others to anticipate our needs before we even are aware of them, but often we're not very clear ourselves about exactly what will meet our needs.</p>
<h4>Requests vs Demands</h4>
<p>Avoid presenting requests in a way that sound like a demand.</p>
<p>Whenever we get people to do things from fear of punishment, shame or guilt, we are experienced as a source of violence, who will make the suffer if they don't comply.</p>
<p>To illustrate the danger of a language that denies choice, Rosenberg provides the example of Nazi war criminal Adolph Eichmann. </p>
<p>At his war trial, asked if it was difficult to send thousands to their deaths, Eichmann responded that their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk9-3bMAGBw">bureaucratic language</a> made it easy. If someone asked why they did it, they would say 'I had no choice', 'superiors orders', 'it's the law'. </p>
<p>Because of this concern, nonviolent communication emphasizes that we avoid any language that implies we have no choice, and that the use of words like 'have to', 'ought', 'must' results in people who don't feel responsible for their actions.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Nonviolent communication not a complex system, but it does express some profound truths that I'm not sure I can properly convey. One of the most impactful, to me, is the concept of retributive justice. I've begun to see how deeply ingrained it is, in my own consciousness, and the world around me. </p>
<p>I feel like there's a lot of ground for me to cover still, in nonviolent communication. I intend to spend a lot more time working on this, what I believe to be the most valuable teaching available for promoting peace on earth.</p>

      <title>Opening up, after a few years of isolation, since I stopped drinking</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I quit drinking and drugs almost three years ago, although I've only been approaching something resembling sobriety since the beginning of this year. </p>
<p>Before I quit drinking, I'd been on a downward spiral for quite some time. My behavior and mindset deteriorated to a shameful state. I was stuck in a cycle of addiction that I didn't know how to escape. When I drank, I didn't have to be concerned with anything of import, I'd regulate my emotions with a 6 pack. I knew I had to find a different way, but that was easier said than done.</p>
<p>Gratefully, I've had some help coming to the stark realization of exactly how far I'd fallen.</p>
<p><img src="/images/david.jpeg" alt="" width="474" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>I grew up with a lot of pain that I attributed to the world around me. While I had some just grievances, much of my angst was misguided. It's taken me too long to realize that. Instead I bitterly rejected what I saw as adversarial social convention meant to control. I inherently distrusted all social convention, which was a direct impediment to becoming a part of something larger than myself.</p>
<p>I set out, in 2007, as a seeker of truth. I had the idea that the world was broken. That corruption and lies were embedded into every sphere of life, that the system was set up against the people for the benefit of the few. </p>
<p>To whatever extent that may have been right, my reaction to those perceived injustices was the primary source for my suffering.</p>
<p>While I shed the external trappings of domination, I sought fulfillment in drugs, alcohol, sex, self-serving pursuits and fleeting experiences. I was full of bitterness, on a self-indulgent trip simply trying to escape, doing nothing to improve my situation or the world around me. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, plenty of others have been working tirelessly to make the world a better place, and actually improved many of the issues I care about.. and I was falling behind.</p>
<p>I have a lot of remorse, and have suffered a great deal of anguish about some of my actions, and state of being, over my years on the road. I was very judgemental, had an unhealthy attitude towards women, made increasingly poor decisions, and grew to cherish my addictions over reason.</p>
<p>I'm here to try and speak to all of that, to open myself to communication, make clear where my current state of mind and intentions are at.</p>
<h3>Nonviolent Communication</h3>
<p>A major turning point in my recovery has been finding <a href="https://baynvc.org/basics-of-nonviolent-communication/"><strong>Nonviolent Communication (NVC)</strong></a>, at the recommendation of my counselor. NVC is now the cornerstone to my recovery, easily the most valuable teaching that I've encountered, and the main reason I'm here and able to write this message. </p>
<p>I'd heard of it years ago, thought I knew what it was and even practiced it to a limited extent, but I had no inkling of its depth or potency. </p>
<p>Nonviolent communication (NVC) consists of a value system that challenges ways of thinking that create violence on this planet. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/book-chapter-1">Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life</a> - Marshall Rosenberg</p>
<p>I'm still pretty new to the subject, but learning about the process and it's underlying philosophy immediately improved my relationship with family, has helped me to deal with anger, by recognizing where it's misplaced, and began helping me to repair old wounds. </p>
<p>It's important for me to not only find healing, but make whatever positive impact in the lives of others that I'm able, and perhaps repair some of the damage I perpetuated. </p>
<h3>Trying to find a path forward</h3>
<p>Lately, I've been delving deeply into the mechanics behind addiction, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), emotional literacy, mindfulness, restorative practices, along with important movements of our day, including Black Lives Matter and the #metoo movement.</p>
<p>I'm not able to devote all of my time to these pursuits, but my energy has been shifting in that direction, since around the new year. I have been saving up a lot of bookmarks, so I'd like to begin sharing regularly on <em>all of the above</em> and see where that goes.</p>]]></description>
