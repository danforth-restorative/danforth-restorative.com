In honor of that fact, I'd like to create an 501c3 educational nonprofit organization, for people learning and working together to develop marketable digital skills, while learning ways that digital tools can expand the reach and potency of our most important messages.</div> </div> </div>";s:10:"expiration";i:1602928804;}
